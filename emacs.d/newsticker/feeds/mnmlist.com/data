Perfect for the readers, which is perfect for the writer. Not so perfect for advertisers and marketers, perhaps, but we&#8217;re not creating sites for them. We&#8217;re creating sites for us.</p>

What&#8217;s necessary for a pure, perfect reading experience?<br /><ol><li>The text of an article, including headline</li><li>A good-sized, readable font</li><li>A column width optimal for reading</li><li>Perhaps the name of the site for context, and minimal navigation in case the reader wants to find other articles</li></ol><div>Nothing else.

<p>Here&#8217;s what a minimalist website should leave out:</p><ul><li>ads</li><li>cookies</li><li>tracking</li><li>popups</li><li>sharing buttons</li><li>comments</li><li>multiple pages/slides per article</li><li>Facebook or other social widgets</li><li>a widget showing recent comments or tweets</li><li>tags or related posts</li><li>syndicated content widgets taking them to other sites so you&#8217;ll get money</li><li>something screaming for the reader to sign up for your newsletter</li></ul>

In addition, a minimal site might also feature:<br /><ul><li>minimal images (none, or only the most necessary)</li><li>the logo of the site in <span class=\"caps\">CSS</span>-styled text, not an image</li><li><a href=\"http://blog.chriszacharias.com/page-weight-matters\">small page weight</a></li><li>short urls (without .php, .asp, .aspx, .html, dates, categories or other items in the url) &#8212; see the url of the posts on this site as an example</li></ul><p>Are there examples of this on the web? Sure, there are plenty. My sites, <a href=\"http://mnmlist.com\">mnmlist.com</a>, <a href=\"http://zenhabits.net\">Zen Habits</a>, and <a href=\"http://leobabauta.com\">leobabauta.com</a> are three examples, but there are many others that come close. Recent networks <a href=\"http://blog.chriszacharias.com/page-weight-matters/\">svtle</a> and <a href=\"https://medium.com/frontpage-picks/348a9f60e176\">medium</a> and <a href=\"http://feathe.rs/201212061530\">feathe.rs</a> come to mind. And there&#8217;s also <a href=\"http://natewienert.com/codename-obtvse\">obtvse</a>. I admire <a href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/index.html\">Paul Graham</a>, and <a href=\"http://sstephenson.us/posts/on-configuration\">Sam Stephenson</a> has only published a couple of articles, but they look great.</p><h2>Why minimal?</h2>
Bloggers and website creators get so caught up in things that they lose sight of what&#8217;s the most important thing: creating a great experience for the reader. The person coming to your site isn&#8217;t a customer, a potential mailing list subscriber, a consumer of advertising, a person who wants to be marketed to, a buyer of your affiliate products, a Facebook or Twitter follower &#8230; he&#8217;s a person who simply wants some information or entertainment from what you&#8217;ve written.

<p>The person (I affectionately call her &#8220;my dear reader&#8221; but really she&#8217;s a person) just wants to read what you have to offer, and perhaps at that point might want to read more or even subscribe. All the other things you might put on your site are not for the reader.</p><p>When you create an amazing reading experience for the reader, he or she will appreciate it. The reader will love your great content (I hope), and then decide whether to bookmark it, email it, share it, subscribe, whatever. But without the reading experience, all the rest isn&#8217;t happening.</p>

All the other stuff is distracting. It detracts from the experience. Sure, maybe it&#8217;ll help you reach your goals as a writer/site creator, but it doesn&#8217;t help the reader reach her goals. So if you put the distractions in to meet your goals, what message are you sending? That your goals are more important than those of the person who has graciously consented to come to your site and give you the gift of her attention.<br /><h2>But what about &#8230;</h2><strong>Comments</strong>: The comments in most cases detract from the reading experience. They&#8217;re not necessary for reading. Good discussion of the post can be continued elsewhere, such as on Twitter or Facebook or other people&#8217;s blogs, if they find the post worth talking about. For a few years, I had comments on my site, and they weren&#8217;t the worst thing, but I&#8217;ve come to the conclusion that they&#8217;re unnecessary.

<p><strong>Subscriptions</strong>: Don&#8217;t popups and big subscription boxes and other such things that ask the reader to subscribe to your mailing list get much better conversion numbers? Sure, in the short term, your numbers will go up. But those are unimportant numbers. Much more important: How much did you delight the reader? How many readers did you lose because you disrespected them with a popup or screaming in the sidebar asking them to subscribe? How much trust did you lose? Who did you help with this popup? Try measuring those numbers with your analytics.</p><p><strong>Sharing</strong>: Don&#8217;t you need sharing buttons to succeed in social media and get a million followers? No, and anyway, that&#8217;s not very important. I&#8217;ve succeeded in large part without sharing buttons (I had them for awhile but removed them) because what I focus on is what I think the reader wants most &#8212; the article. If they want to share, they know how to do that. And for those who just care about the article, and not sharing, having a million sharing buttons in their face just ruins the reading experience.</p><p><strong>Analytics</strong>: How do I know if I&#8217;m growing without analytics? You don&#8217;t really, and honestly, it doesn&#8217;t matter as much as people think. I used to track my blog&#8217;s statistics, and when you track something like that, it becomes your world. You care so much about growing it that you do things aimed directly at growing the numbers. And that&#8217;s crazy &#8212; the numbers don&#8217;t matter that much. What matters is helping your readers, delighting them, changing their lives. You don&#8217;t do those things by worrying about the numbers &#8212; you do them by worry about the readers. And when you do that, the growth comes as a byproduct of being great.</p><p><strong>Making money</strong>: I am a strong believer in making a living doing what you love, but does it really feel good to force your readers to look at crappy ads or see a &#8220;Sponsored By&#8221; post in their inbox, so you can make a few bucks? I used to do it, and it grated on me, because I personally detest advertising. It&#8217;s a daily annoyance that we put up with in order to get what we want (watch the news, be entertained, ride the bus, read good articles) but why put your readers through this annoyance? You can make money as a writer or website creator without ads, without being a slimy marketer. Just build an audience by being useful and trustworthy, then help them with books, courses, software, a service, or whatever you can create that helps them even more deeply. Making money by helping people? Now that feels good.</p>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://mnmlist.com/w/feed/") (slash:comments nil "0")) (item nil (title nil "all our fantasies") (link nil "http://mnmlist.com/fantasies/") (comments nil "http://mnmlist.com/fantasies/#comments") (pubDate nil "Fri, 14 Sep 2012 20:42:59 +0000") (dc:creator nil "Leo") (category nil "mind") (guid ((isPermaLink .

Goals are fantasies. Sometimes fantasies come true &#8212; but even then, the reality that comes true is not exactly what we fantasized about. It&#8217;s a disappointment.</p><p>If you saw the announcement of the iPhone5 recently, you might be fantasizing about owning it (or any other gadget for that matter). You fantasize that it will make your life better, that you&#8217;ll feel cooler. Your image of yourself, as you use this incredibly cool gadget, is nicer. It&#8217;s part of a beautiful, simple, productive, enjoyable life that you fantasize about &#8212; the iPhone5 will help you get there!</p><p>Of course, this isn&#8217;t true. The iPhone5 might be faster, with a better camera, lighter, a more beautiful design &#8230; but none of these things will really make your life that much better. Will it save you a few seconds a day in doing the tasks you normally do? Sure. Will your photos be nicer? Yeah. But putting aside the fantasy, how much will your life really be different?</p><p>Think of life before the iPhone existed. We used to be able to work without them. We walked around without checking email or Twitter or our stocks, but &#8230; we somehow survived. It was possible to wait a few minutes or an hour until we got home or to work. We maybe couldn&#8217;t look restaurants up as easily, but we still found food, miraculously.</p><p>Life might have been different, but having this device didn&#8217;t change the basic fundamental nature of our lives. The fantasy hasn&#8217;t come true.</p><p>It might sound like I&#8217;m picking on the iPhone, but I don&#8217;t mean to. It&#8217;s just emblematic of an overall phenomena in our minds &#8212; the fantasies we have, and how reality never measures up. We&#8217;re disappointed in reality then, even if it&#8217;s actually more incredible than the fantasies themselves.</p><p>Minimalism is a fantasy as well. People buy into it because it&#8217;s a lovely idea, living with little, being content, having a spartan workspace and living room. I buy into it, absolutely. But minimalism doesn&#8217;t have to be a fantasy: I also use it as a tool for mindfulness, for living more consciously, for remembering what&#8217;s important.</p><p>Minimalism can be a tool for remembering that when we buy gadgets, or almost anything really, we are buying into a fantasy. And then we can remember that we don&#8217;t need the fantasy to be happy. We have something right in front of us: reality.</p><p>Reality, without fantasies, is perfect. It&#8217;s a gift.

Search <span class=\"caps\">IMDB.</span>com. Google, Reddit, Facebook, Twitter, et al will tell you anything you want to know, right now.</p><p>Isn&#8217;t that incredible? Just 20 years ago, that was unthinkable. If you wanted to know something, you might turn on the TV and hope to get lucky, or look in your encyclopedias (if you had them) and hope to get lucky, or go to the library and hope to get lucky. Most of the time, you had to settle on not knowing.</p><p>One of the things I&#8217;ve noticed from <a href=\"http://zenhabits.net/offline/\">turning off my computer</a> periodically throughout the day (I work in 30-minute chunks), is that when the computer is off, I often think of a question I want answered &#8212; and my first instinct is to go to the computer and search. I&#8217;d know in like 4 seconds!</p><p>But then I pause, and examine that urge. Is it a true need, to know right now? Can I not wait 30 minutes, or even a few hours, or a day? Of course I can. It&#8217;s not a matter of life or death, or national security, or anything important really.</p><p>And so I stop myself, and make a note to look it up later. Then I notice something else interesting: not knowing is a strange phenomena to me, now. Not knowing is something I am not familiar with. <span class=\"caps\">OK, </span>sure, there are a gazillion things I don&#8217;t know, every moment of my life, but when I want to know something, I will usually know, really really quickly. Now I don&#8217;t know something I want to know, for at least half an hour, sometimes more.</p><p>And then I realize: this is a strange freedom. Not knowing something means I am walking around blind, without a direct path, and I must live with that, work with that. It&#8217;s interesting. It&#8217;s a different way of living. How our ancestors must have lived! (Or, you know, me in the early 90s.)</p><p>Not knowing isn&#8217;t bad. It&#8217;s just different. And really, I think there&#8217;s something minimalist about it.

Living in a <a href=\"http://rowdykittens.com/our-tiny-house/\">small home</a> or <a href=\"http://tynan.com/living-in-a-small-rv-introduction\">an RV</a> might make everyone think you&#8217;re poor or crazy.

They really don&#8217;t care &#8212; they just don&#8217;t like things different because they are uncomfortable with change.

Other people didn&#8217;t just make them up &#8212; they are customs built up over the years, often very consciously by corporations trying to get us into expensive buying habits.

I live in society, and yet no one minds me wearing the same clothes all the time. People don&#8217;t go wild with anger when they hear that I&#8217;m not buying Christmas presents. I might get a raised eyebrow when they find out I don&#8217;t have cable TV or a car, and I might have to explain myself when they hear I&#8217;m a vegan, but no one gets mad at me and they go on with their lives. I sure go on with mine.</p><p>The way everyone else does things isn&#8217;t working. People aren&#8217;t happy with a life filled with possessions. Driving cars all the time adds to stress, makes people unhealthier, pollutes. People get unhealthy with their standard American diet. Just because everyone else thinks this is the way it should be done, doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s the best way.

Are you happy with them, or would you like things to change? Think about what you do each day, and ask if you&#8217;re happy with your daily life, or if you&#8217;d like change. Think about the people in your life, and ask if you&#8217;re happy with them, or if you&#8217;d like them to change. Think about yourself, and see if there are things you&#8217;re dissatisfied with, if you&#8217;d like to change yourself.</p><p>Now, for each thing you think needs change, try sitting for a minute and see if you can simply accept each one, as they are right now. See if you can accept each person in your life for who they are, exactly as they are. See if you can accept your body for what it is, without the need for change. It takes practice, so if you aren&#8217;t good at it at first (and I&#8217;m still not a master at it myself), practice.

New toys that are fun, useful and beautiful all at once.</p><p>And while I see the attraction of these devices &#8212; I&#8217;ve been tempted myself many times &#8212; I also know that they are some of the best marketing devices ever.</p><p>Yes, they are useful. Thousands of books on one tiny reading device? Amazing, in all sincerity. I&#8217;m all for something that encourages reading and lightness at once. They can also be used for work, email, social networking, showing off family photos, watching films, listening to uplifting music, teaching kids math and reading, exploring new worlds &#8230; these are very very useful devices, I&#8217;ll admit.</p><p>But once you get one, what&#8217;s the first thing you do? You go to buy some content. Because at their heart, these are content devices, and they come loaded with a little content but not nearly enough to last a day. So you buy books, and this is Amazon&#8217;s main goal with the Kindle, and it is wildly successful. The Kindle might cost you $79 (or a bit more), but you&#8217;ll spend hundreds if not thousands of dollars on books.</p><p>And books are just the start of the buying. If you have an iPad, you&#8217;ll buy movies and TV shows and music along with the books. The Kindle Fire will get you to buy these media too. If you have an iPhone or iPod, the music is a must, but other media are also bought in bushels. Android and Nook devices are no different.</p><p>Then there are apps. Apple has sold millions of apps from the app store, which means if you have one of their devices, you are likely to buy a bunch as soon as you get your new toy.</p><p>So if someone has given you a beautiful new device, they&#8217;ve given you a gift that will cost you probably thousands of dollars, not including the cost of connecting the device (which could be just as much money if you need a data plan).</p><p>I am not disparaging anyone who has bought or received these devices. They are useful and attractive. But let&#8217;s acknowledge their true purpose.

He wasn&#8217;t sure what would be important, so he did everything possible, because he was afraid he wouldn&#8217;t do well if he missed something important. When I launch a product, I keep it simple, but try to make what little I do provide very valuable. I do very little to launch the product, because I&#8217;ve learned that doesn&#8217;t matter as much as creating a great product and having readers who trust me. I do less, but I know what matters, and focus on that.</p><p>Fear of missing something important causes us to use the buckshot approach, and do too much. Most of what we do will miss, but we console ourselves that something will hit the important target. The problem is, we don&#8217;t know what the target is, and using the buckshot approach means we&#8217;ll never get good at finding the target, nor good at aiming.</p><p>The rifle approach means you&#8217;ll be forced to figure out what&#8217;s important.

Bloggers and website creators get so caught up in things that they lose sight of what’s the most important thing: creating a great experience for the reader. The person coming to your site isn’t a customer, a potential mailing list subscriber, a consumer of advertising, a person who wants to be marketed to, a buyer of your affiliate products, a Facebook or Twitter follower … he’s a person who simply wants some information or entertainment from what you’ve written.
<p>The person (I affectionately call her “my dear reader” but really she’s a person) just wants to read what you have to offer, and perhaps at that point might want to read more or even subscribe. All the other things you might put on your site are not for the reader.</p><p>When you create an amazing reading experience for the reader, he or she will appreciate it. The reader will love your great content (I hope), and then decide whether to bookmark it, email it, share it, subscribe, whatever. But without the reading experience, all the rest isn’t happening.</p>
All the other stuff is distracting. It detracts from the experience. Sure, maybe it’ll help you reach your goals as a writer/site creator, but it doesn’t help the reader reach her goals. So if you put the distractions in to meet your goals, what message are you sending? That your goals are more important than those of the person who has graciously consented to come to your site and give you the gift of her attention.<br /><h2>But what about …</h2><strong>Comments</strong>: The comments in most cases detract from the reading experience. They’re not necessary for reading. Good discussion of the post can be continued elsewhere, such as on Twitter or Facebook or other people’s blogs, if they find the post worth talking about. For a few years, I had comments on my site, and they weren’t the worst thing, but I’ve come to the conclusion that they’re unnecessary.
<p><strong>Subscriptions</strong>: Don’t popups and big subscription boxes and other such things that ask the reader to subscribe to your mailing list get much better conversion numbers? Sure, in the short term, your numbers will go up. But those are unimportant numbers. Much more important: How much did you delight the reader? How many readers did you lose because you disrespected them with a popup or screaming in the sidebar asking them to subscribe? How much trust did you lose? Who did you help with this popup? Try measuring those numbers with your analytics.</p><p><strong>Sharing</strong>: Don’t you need sharing buttons to succeed in social media and get a million followers? No, and anyway, that’s not very important. I’ve succeeded in large part without sharing buttons (I had them for awhile but removed them) because what I focus on is what I think the reader wants most — the article. If they want to share, they know how to do that. And for those who just care about the article, and not sharing, having a million sharing buttons in their face just ruins the reading experience.</p><p><strong>Analytics</strong>: How do I know if I’m growing without analytics? You don’t really, and honestly, it doesn’t matter as much as people think. I used to track my blog’s statistics, and when you track something like that, it becomes your world. You care so much about growing it that you do things aimed directly at growing the numbers. And that’s crazy — the numbers don’t matter that much. What matters is helping your readers, delighting them, changing their lives. You don’t do those things by worrying about the numbers — you do them by worry about the readers. And when you do that, the growth comes as a byproduct of being great.</p><p><strong>Making money</strong>: I am a strong believer in making a living doing what you love, but does it really feel good to force your readers to look at crappy ads or see a “Sponsored By” post in their inbox, so you can make a few bucks? I used to do it, and it grated on me, because I personally detest advertising. It’s a daily annoyance that we put up with in order to get what we want (watch the news, be entertained, ride the bus, read good articles) but why put your readers through this annoyance? You can make money as a writer or website creator without ads, without being a slimy marketer. Just build an audience by being useful and trustworthy, then help them with books, courses, software, a service, or whatever you can create that helps them even more deeply. Making money by helping people?

New toys that are fun, useful and beautiful all at once.</p><p>And while I see the attraction of these devices — I’ve been tempted myself many times — I also know that they are some of the best marketing devices ever.</p><p>Yes, they are useful. Thousands of books on one tiny reading device? Amazing, in all sincerity. I’m all for something that encourages reading and lightness at once. They can also be used for work, email, social networking, showing off family photos, watching films, listening to uplifting music, teaching kids math and reading, exploring new worlds … these are very very useful devices, I’ll admit.</p><p>But once you get one, what’s the first thing you do? You go to buy some content. Because at their heart, these are content devices, and they come loaded with a little content but not nearly enough to last a day. So you buy books, and this is Amazon’s main goal with the Kindle, and it is wildly successful. The Kindle might cost you $79 (or a bit more), but you’ll spend hundreds if not thousands of dollars on books.</p><p>And books are just the start of the buying. If you have an iPad, you’ll buy movies and TV shows and music along with the books. The Kindle Fire will get you to buy these media too. If you have an iPhone or iPod, the music is a must, but other media are also bought in bushels. Android and Nook devices are no different.</p><p>Then there are apps.

New toys that are fun, useful and beautiful all at once.</p><p>And while I see the attraction of these devices &#8212; I&#8217;ve been tempted myself many times &#8212; I also know that they are some of the best marketing devices ever.</p><p>Yes, they are useful. Thousands of books on one tiny reading device? Amazing, in all sincerity. I&#8217;m all for something that encourages reading and lightness at once. They can also be used for work, email, social networking, showing off family photos, watching films, listening to uplifting music, teaching kids math and reading, exploring new worlds &#8230; these are very very useful devices, I&#8217;ll admit.</p><p>But once you get one, what&#8217;s the first thing you do? You go to buy some content. Because at their heart, these are content devices, and they come loaded with a little content but not nearly enough to last a day. So you buy books, and this is Amazon&#8217;s main goal with the Kindle, and it is wildly successful. The Kindle might cost you $79 (or a bit more), but you&#8217;ll spend hundreds if not thousands of dollars on books.</p><p>And books are just the start of the buying. If you have an iPad, you&#8217;ll buy movies and TV shows and music along with the books. The Kindle Fire will get you to buy these media too. If you have an iPhone or iPod, the music is a must, but other media are also bought in bushels. Android and Nook devices are no different.</p><p>Then there are apps.
