A variety of backers also received their console in the mail with the controller's removable faceplates already removed, having slipped off during shipment. OUYA's addressing at least some of these concerns by <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2013/03/28/ouya-at-retail-june-4/\">the console's June 4th launch</a>, company CEO Julie Uhrman promises in a letter to backers on OUYA's official site.</p><p> \"Our software is constantly evolving,\" Uhrman says. As such, OUYA has \"a host of features\" that it's working on adding to the console ahead of its impending retail launch: \"external storage for games, simpler game install process, more metrics for developers, controller support for video players, and more payment options.\" But first, Uhrman says her team is \"focused on optimizing the performance of our software (this mean responsiveness),\" directly addressing criticisms of the console's seeming lag between input and on-screen response. <span>As for the controller, OUYA is \"considering adding additional magnets\" to help with the faceplate issue -- the controller's faceplates are attached via six magnets apiece, currently. It's unclear if the controller will change in any other significant ways ahead of the console's retail availability, but we're hopeful that the button sticking issue is also addressed.</span></p><p>Filed under: <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/gaming/\" rel=\"tag\">Gaming</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/software/\" rel=\"tag\">Software</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/hd/\" rel=\"tag\">HD</a></p><p><strong><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2013/04/05/ouya-updates-before-launch/#comments\">Comments</a></strong></p><p><strong>Source:</strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ouya.tv/60-days-to-launch/\">OUYA</a></p>") (category nil "android") (category nil "hdpostcross") (category nil "julieuhrman") (category nil "ouya") (dc:creator nil "Ben Gilbert") (pubDate nil "Fri, 05 Apr 2013 17:57:00")) (item nil (title nil "Editorial: The imperialism of Facebook Home") (link nil "http://www.engadget.com/2013/04/05/the-imperialism-of-facebook-home/") (guid ((isPermaLink .

This doesn't necessarily indicate a seismic shift in the industry, but it certainly suggests that we won't be looking at a world so thoroughly dominated by the direct descendant of KHTML. At least at first, the new entrant won't actually deviate much from WebKit. Primarily the focus will be on stripping away unnecessary code and files to streamline the rendering engine specifically for Chrome. Obviously, this won't prevent other developers from using Blink, since the project is open source. But Google has been pretty up front about the rationale behind the fork -- the <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2010/04/09/apple-announces-webkit2-with-chrome-like-process-splitting/\">multi-process architecture</a> favored by Chromium-based projects is quite different than that used in other WebKit browsers.

It's the first phone running the Facebook Home interface, which will be available on many devices starting on April 12th.

As <em>Bloomberg</em> mentions in its report, Fisker has to date only sold 2,500 of its electric vehicles, which have been beset by <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2011/09/15/fisker-karma-pushes-deliveries-back-again-as-it-awaits-federal-e/\">delays</a> and <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2012/08/18/fisker-completes-investigation-of-latest-karma-ev-fire-issues-c/\">recalls</a> in recent years.</p><p>Filed under: <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/transportation/\" rel=\"tag\">Transportation</a></p><p><strong><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2013/04/05/fisker-announces-steep-layoffs-cuts-company-down-to-25-percent/#comments\">Comments</a></strong></p><p><strong>Source:</strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-05/fisker-said-to-fire-80-of-staff-as-deal-evades-plug-in-carmaker.html\">Bloomberg</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.autoblog.com/2013/04/05/fisker-pr-team-and-many-other-employees-face-layoff-this-morning/\">Autoblog</a></p>") (category nil "electicvehicle") (category nil "ev") (category nil "fisker") (category nil "FiskerAutomotive") (category nil "karma") (category nil "layoffs") (dc:creator nil "Donald Melanson") (pubDate nil "Fri, 05 Apr 2013 15:13:00")) (item nil (title nil "T-Mobile carrier update for unlocked iPhones now available, bringing Visual Voicemail and LTE support") (link nil "http://www.engadget.com/2013/04/05/t-mobile-carrier-update-for-iphone/") (guid ((isPermaLink .

By stringing together thousands of these so-called droplets (which measure about 50 microns across) using a custom-built 3D printer, the Oxford team believes it has <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/tag/bioengineering/\">engineered a \"new type of material\"</a> that could eventually be used to ferry drugs throughout our internal systems to a specific target site, fill-in for damaged tissues or even mimic neural pathways via specially printed protein pores. The potential applications for medical science are impressive enough, but consider this additional benefit: since the droplets contain no genetic material, scientists can completely sidestep all the ethical red tape surrounding the alternative stem cell approach to artificial tissue. At present, the team's been able to string about 35,000 of the droplets together, but there's no real cap as to how large or even what type of networks can be made.

We dream of a world with no more flat-pack furniture, no more obtuse construction manuals and no more missing screws. Smart foam tech might get us closer to those  admittedly small-time dreams. Using cross links within the foam's particle arrangement, regardless of how much the structure is compressed, it'll spring back to the predesigned shape. Designer Carl de Smet adds that the product would expand at a set temperature getting a little doughy in the middle, then more solid at room temperature<span>. </span></p><p><span>He also demonstrates another smart foam structure which changes when a current is fed through it. Electricity provides the heat that transforms the rolled-up structure into a flat one, with the current experimental version taking around five minutes to completely settle. </span><span>Commercial products which are apparently only about a year to 18 months away and as de Smet details in the video, could land on store shelves in a compacted rolled-up form for \"unpacking\" back home. These early examples can even be adjusted, if for some reason you suddenly decide you wanted  a coffee table, not a chair.

We've already seen it launch in Australia and the UK, where it's available for free when subscribing to relatively frugal postpaid plans of either $29 AUD (on Virgin Mobile Australia) or <span>&pound;22 (on </span><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/tag/O2/\">O2</a><span> UK); Brits can also spend </span><span>&pound;300 at O2 to use the phone on a pay-as-you-go basis.

As a reminder, it's not coming to the US in an official capacity: while the mid-tier device made a <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2013/03/05/nokia-lumia-720-swings-by-the-fcc/\">visit to the FCC</a>, the absence of LTE largely precludes American carrier deals.

Just remember that should you opt into an iPhone 5 through T-Mobile then decide to opt out of your contract, the device will stay carrier locked until you <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2013/03/26/t-mobile-handsets-will-remain-network-locked/\">pay it off</a> or <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2013/03/26/t-mobile-if-you-cancel-you-own-the-phone-but-you-can-trade/\">trade it back</a> -- unless you're willing to <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2013/01/26/unlock-phone-exemption-ends/\">skirt the law</a>, of course.

Sure, it saves you from financial doom when the housing market collapses, and it certainly is a lot more affordable when you're feeling a bit resource-constrained, but it can cause some massive headaches.

For $30 with a two-year contract (after the dreaded $50 mail-in rebate, mind), the device sits on the fence that separates entry-level from mid-range.
