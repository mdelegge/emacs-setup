The game &#8211; 3079 &#8211; is a little on the weird and rough side, but in a good way. But today,</p><p>Today&#8230; I just want to share this video from Felicia Day&#8217;s &#8220;Geek and Sundry&#8221; channel. Some indies and gamers have been offended by it. Me? I think it&#8217;s hilarious. But then I don&#8217;t make the kind of games that are getting teased here. And &#8211; from what I understand &#8211; the makers of the video are friends with some of the indies they are joking about here, so it&#8217;s all in good fun.<br /><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/iXlw9mLFpUw\" height=\"360\" width=\"640\" allowfullscreen=\" \" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe><br />
Watching this video, I thought a little bit about <a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/shows/gamespot-live/?event=2013_igf_gdc_awards_live20130327\">Andy Schatz&#8217;s opening speech</a> at this year&#8217;s IGF award ceremony. He noted how indie is slowly becoming mainstream, and the mainstream industry that used to dismiss us now treats us as if they like us. He said, &#8220;<em>We’re still punk, but the whole world is a little punk now. Like it or not, we’re not The Clash anymore. We’re Green Day.</em>&#8221; Indie has won. This is a good thing, and it&#8217;s a healthy development for the medium. But indies have gone from being the little tiny rebels-with-a-cause to&#8230; something else. It&#8217;s a weird transition.</p><p>And we&#8217;ve become popular enough that people are starting to make jokes about us.</p><p>But meanwhile &#8211; while I love innovation and the occasional weird game, I&#8217;m also pretty jaded and know dang well that 90% of innovation doesn&#8217;t yield good results, and weirdness is not strictly a virtue. I&#8217;m a fan of busting outside of the comfort zone and blazing new trails, but I&#8217;m also keen on using our roots, our legacy, as a base camp.</p><p>So for the weekend &#8212; I&#8217;m not giving away a free game this time. INSTEAD &#8211; I&#8217;m going to give someone here the chance to have a character named after them in Frayed Knights 2. Someone from today&#8217;s comments gets to pick a name (including their own) for a character in Frayed Knights 2. It&#8217;s my little thank-you to the community. Or, if you prefer, my little way of being a lazy bum and outsourcing design work to the community. Either way. You&#8217;ll have a choice of one of several options, including whether they&#8217;ll be a friendly or enemy character. You can provide the name (within reasonable limits &#8211; in other words, don&#8217;t be obnoxious about it).</p><p>This contest will run the ENTIRE weekend. The winner will be contacted on Monday. Ish. (It&#8217;s fun working with an entire world of time-zones).</p><p>To participate, just leave a comment for this post. About indie games.  Possibly inspired by the above video. Some suggestions:</p><p>#1 &#8211; Why indie games are cool.</p><p>Or</p><p>#2 &#8211; Why indie games are becoming annoyingly pretentious</p><p>Or</p><p>#3 &#8211; What is your favorite indie RPG? Or favorite BESIDES <strong>Frayed Knights: The Skull of S&#8217;makh-Daon</strong>, if you prefer, because Frayed Knights is obviously everyone&#8217;s favorite, and not just because it is annoyingly pretentious and everybody who plays it totally gets it.</p><p>Or</p><p>#4 &#8211; Now that mainstream games are starting to get friendly with indies, what sort of things would you expect to see? What would be an epic (or an epically STRANGE) mash-up between AAA and indie?</p><p>Or whatever else you wanna say. Have at it! And have fun!</p><p>(And remember to use a valid email address so I can contact you if you are the winner. I&#8217;m the only one who&#8217;ll see it, and that&#8217;s the only use it will be put to&#8230;)</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

This is kinda the fourth RPG in their series, starting with the awkwardly named &#8220;<strong>Divine Divinity</strong>.&#8221; GOG.COM has already gotten behind these guys (and <strong>Torment</strong>) and committed to be a distributor, and a good deal of the game is already finished (to the point that they expect to ship by the end of the year).

Inspired by <strong>Minecraft</strong> and <strong>Fallout</strong>, 3079 is a futuristic, open-world action first-person role playing game. You arrive on a planet experiencing constant war. It is your duty to find out why the warring factions cannot find peace on their own &amp; hopefully restore it yourself. All areas, buildings, items, quests and characters are randomly generated. And it&#8217;s&#8230;. cubey. Quite cubey. But while it looks like Minecraft, it plays pretty differently.</p><p>Winning this game will be a little different today. There&#8217;s no right answer. Instead, I want to talk about the demise of LucasArts. You can skip down to the end for details, but basically &#8211; I want to hear about your favorite LucasArts game in the comments.</p><p><strong>R.I.P. LucasArts</strong></p><p>I think it was a bookstore where I first saw some games proudly displaying the logo for &#8220;LucasFilm Games.&#8221; <strong>Ballblazer</strong> and <strong>Rescue on Fractalis</strong>, I think they were. I couldn&#8217;t afford them, and knew little about them beyond the screenshots and text on the cardboard boxes, and to this day I have never played them. But at the time, my thought was, &#8220;AWESOME! George Lucas is making video games now!&#8221; Even at the time, I realized that the filmmaker was probably not sweating 6502 Assembly code or anything, but I did believe he&#8217;d be overseeing production in some capacity. Maybe he did, on those first games. I don&#8217;t know.</p><p>Eventually, LucasFilm Games became LucasArts, and through the 1990s they were a powerhouse. Many of their best games were actually created externally, through companies like Totally Games (<strong>X-Wing</strong> and <strong>TIE Fighter</strong>).  Formerly, Lawrence Holland had worked internally with LucasArts to create one of my favorite early flight sims (circa 1989), <strong>Their Finest Hour: the Battle of Britain</strong>. My favorite part of that game was actually the manual.  It remains one of the best-written game manuals of all time &#8211; a distinction that it is unlikely to lose in an era where <strong>Pong</strong>&#8216;s instructions are likely to be bypassed by the TL;DR crowd. Half of the manual was a history of the war, complete with stories told by pilots who&#8217;d been on both sides of the battle.</p><p><strong><a href=\"http://rampantgames.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/x-wing.png\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-5741\" alt=\"x-wing\" src=\"http://rampantgames.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/x-wing.png\" width=\"320\" height=\"200\" align=\"left\" hspace=\"9\" vspace=\"4\" /></a>X-Wing</strong> was awesomeness surpassed only by the sequel <strong>TIE Fighter</strong>, but I still preferred the first game simply because it fulfilled a longstanding fantasy. I was a hardcore <strong>Wing Commander</strong> fan at the time, and the two games were very different in style. I was trying to explain to a friend (and fellow <strong>X-Wing</strong> addict) about how I&#8217;d like to blend the strengths of the two games, and she shook her head and explained, &#8220;For you, <strong>X-Wing</strong> is a game. For me, it&#8217;s more of a religion.&#8221;</p><p>Another great movie tie-in title that I loved was <strong>Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis</strong>. It was a wonderful blend of Monkey Island style humor and adventure-gamey goodness, coupled with an all-new adventure for the bullwhip-wielding hero, which as far as I&#8217;m concerned might as well be canon. After all, it was better than that <em>Crystal Skull</em> movie&#8230; Actually, IMO it was better than all but the first movie.</p><p>Embarrassingly, I&#8217;ve never played <strong>Day of the Tentacle</strong> or <strong>Maniac Mansion</strong>. That may be grounds for evicting me from the adventure gaming fan club, but I can at least say I&#8217;ve seen good portions of both games being played. Really, <strong>Loom</strong> was my introduction to the graphic adventure games of the 1990s &#8211; which I sadly finished in only two days (and could have finished in a single day if I&#8217;d realized I was so close to the end). After waiting a couple of days to play it because LucasArts had to send a replacement for a bad disk (which they did promptly with no fuss, I should add), it was kind of a let down. We replayed it on maximum difficulty to get the somewhat lame special scene only available in hard mode, but I do remember the story being really enchanting and cool. Just&#8230; short.</p><p>Not short enough to dissuade me from trying out <strong>The Secret of Monkey Island</strong>. Wow. The first two <strong>Monkey Island</strong> games were&#8230; just beyond awesome. Except for the stupid &#8220;Monkey Wrench&#8221; puzzle in <strong>MI2</strong>. I was very gratified to hear that Tim Schafer has finally admitted that that puzzle was stupid and unfair. I feel vindicated, twenty years later. I didn&#8217;t play the later <strong>Monkey Island</strong> games to completion, but in retrospect they were really good games. And the far more recent Tales of Monkey Island series from Telltale Games continue the tradition admirably.</p><p>And there were others. <strong>Sam &amp; Max</strong>, for example, which was bizarre yet cool &#8211; which I keep promising myself I&#8217;ll finish one day. And <strong>Full Throttle</strong> &#8211; another one I&#8217;m rather regretful that I missed, which people tell me was an even more spectacular example of the graphic adventure genre than <strong>Day of the Tentacle</strong>.</p><p><a href=\"http://rampantgames.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/GrimFandangoCover.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-5742\" alt=\"GrimFandangoCover\" src=\"http://rampantgames.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/GrimFandangoCover.jpg\" width=\"256\" height=\"341\" align=\"right\" hspace=\"9\" vspace=\"4\" /></a>But the best adventure game of them all &#8211; to this day &#8211; remains Schafer&#8217;s <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grim_Fandango\"><strong>Grim Fandango</strong></a>. I&#8217;m not sure I can tell you why &#8211; it&#8217;s been so long since I played through the whole thing.  I think it was a combination of the delightful weirdness of the setting (an entire world based on the Mexican Day of the Dead festival mixed with film noir? Really?), and the absolutely rock-solid, lovable (and hate-able) characters.</p><p>And one of the most loveable was the main character. While Manuel Calevera was the source of plenty of comedy on his own (spoken with a Mexican Spanish accent),  he was very, very different from other comic main characters like Guybrush Threepwood. He&#8217;s a film noir hero with comic timing &#8211; assertive, worldly, ambitious. At the end of one chapter, he finds himself stuck in a restaurant, inheriting the janitor&#8217;s job while he waits to find the girl, Mercedes (&#8220;Meche&#8221;).  The scene shifts to the next chapter &#8211; one year later &#8211; and Manny is now the owner of said establishment, and has turned it into a hot nightclub on the waterfront that might as well have been named &#8220;Rick&#8217;s Cafe&#8221; from the movie Casablanca.</p><p>And then there was Glottis. Glottis the elemental, Glottis the mechanic, Glottis the guy who can turn a hearse into a hot-rod.</p><p>And, sadly, the game was quite nearly the end for LucasArts adventure games. And, at least for me, the end of the time when LucasArts really mattered to me. They had one more lukewarm <strong>Monkey Island</strong> sequel in them, and that was that. At least until they licensed some remakes and the <strong>Tales of Monkey Island</strong>.</p><p>It&#8217;s been over a decade since then, and while there have been some really awesome Star Wars licensed games (<strong>LEGO Star Wars</strong>, the <strong>Knights of the Old Republic</strong> RPGs) in the intervening years, LucasArts as a developer and publisher has really been dead for a long time for me.  The people who made it awesome &#8211; who made these wonderful games &#8211; have since gone off and joined or started other companies. And they continue to do great things and make great games.</p><p>So really, the great studio that was LucasArts isn&#8217;t really dead. It&#8217;s just moved on. Literally. I feel bad for the approximately 150 employees let go by yesterday&#8217;s action, and hope they will rapidly find new employment and do great things in the games industry. Or maybe go indie and wow us with their skills. But yeah &#8211; LucasArts has really been pretty dead for a long time. So while I&#8217;m sad to see the era officially come to an end, if I were in Disney&#8217;s shoes, I&#8217;d probably have made the same decision.</p><p><strong>WIN A GAME</strong></p><p>Okay, so instead of doing <strong>Frayed Knights</strong> related trivia today, I just want your post in the comments telling us what your favorite LucasArts game is, and why.  Please use your real email address, which nobody else can see but I can use to contact you. I&#8217;ll pick a winner at random from among the commenters.  If for some reason you do not want the game (don&#8217;t want to deal with Gamer&#8217;s Gate, or you already have the game), add the note (N/G) (for &#8220;No Game&#8221;) to your comment, but feel free to participate.</p><p>Let&#8217;s all lift a glass to the LucasArts of old. The studio may be gone, but the legacy lives on in spades!</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

So here&#8217;s what we can do.</p><p><strong><a href=\"http://frayedknights.com\">Frayed Knights: The Skull of S&#8217;makh-Daon</a></strong> remains my pride and joy. While I&#8217;m all excited about the sequel and everything, Frayed Knights is one of my greatest accomplishments &#8211; a culmination of a childhood dream. Sure, I&#8217;ve made games that have sold more (a <em>lot</em> more). But this &#8220;little&#8221; indie game is the biggest game I&#8217;ve ever worked on, beyond the old AAA titles that cost seven digits in budget. I&#8217;d like to share it.</p><p>So, first of all, I&#8217;m putting it on sale for the next two weeks. From now until the 16th, <strong>Frayed Knights: The Skull of S&#8217;makh-Daon</strong> is 50% off through <a href=\"http://www.desura.com/games/frayed-knights-the-skull-of-smakh-daon\">Desura</a> and <a href=\"https://secure.bmtmicro.com/servlets/Orders.ShoppingCart?CID=7010&amp;PRODUCTID=70100000\">BMT Micro</a>. So if you <em>still</em> haven&#8217;t played it, this is a golden opportunity.There are no codes, just a 50% discount for a few days. And don&#8217;t forget &#8211; <a href=\"http://rampantgames.com/frayedknights/guide1.html\">the strategy guide is still free</a>. And it&#8217;s a lot more than a strategy guide. Like the game itself, I kinda went waaaaaay overboard when I wrote it.</p><p>My frustration, your gain.</p><p>Okay, next up: Many of you reading this blog are seasoned veterans of <strong>Frayed Knights</strong>. In fact, I know some of you (not just the testers!) have played through the complete game several times.  You guys are awesome. So for you guys &#8211; and for some of the folks who are just CRPG experts in general &#8211; I&#8217;m going to run some trivia contests over the next couple of weeks. The trivia will usually be about <strong>Frayed Knights</strong> (especially dealing with points that may have bearing on the sequel), but not always. Prizes will include some free games (some may require that you be on certain services, like Steam or Gamers Gate), or a chance to contribute details to the <strong>Frayed Knights</strong> sequel.</p><p>At the end of the two week period, I&#8217;ll be announcing a few more details about <strong>Frayed Knights 2</strong> (including its official title&#8230; which a couple of you have known for a very long time, like since FK1 was released).</p><p>Anyway, it should be fun.  I just hope I can keep up&#8230;</p><p>TODAY&#8217;S CONTEST</p><p>So here&#8217;s the first trivia contest. Please email your answers to <em><a href=\"mailto:feedback@rampantgames.com\">feedback@rampantgames.com</a></em>. Use the subject line, &#8220;April 2 Trivia Answer&#8221;. Be specific! I&#8217;m going to be drawing randomly from the correct answers (I expect a lot!), and the winner will be revealed tomorrow morning. Please &#8211; if you don&#8217;t want to prizes, don&#8217;t enter the contest.  You&#8217;ll have until midnight Pacific Time to answer the question.</p><p>Today&#8217;s contest is for a free copy of the original game <strong>Torchlight</strong> via Steam. So if you don&#8217;t want <strong>Torchlight 1</strong>, or don&#8217;t use Steam, you can sit this one out&#8230;</p><p>It&#8217;s an easy one. But it&#8217;s a two-part question, so don&#8217;t mess up and only give half an answer. Here goes&#8230;</p><p>A sentient, disease-ridden, and exceptionally nearsighted race of rodents have infested WHAT farmhouse in Ardin (the family name), and what is the name of the evil god whom they worship?</p><p>Okay, we&#8217;ll have the answer, the winner&#8217;s name, and a new contest tomorrow morning.

Or, rather, a former priest of Pokmor Xang, as there was only one known temple where the the religion was practiced, and it is no longer in operation after not just one but TWO attacks by greedy adventurers after their secrets and treasures. Flemmins fortunately survived both assaults, and was willing to talk to me about the secret life of a priest of the pus god.</p><p><strong>Rampant Coyote:</strong> So Birz, how did you first come to follow Pokmor Xang, the god of Blisters, Boils, and Pimples?</p><p><strong>Birz Flemmins:</strong> Well, me family &#8211; particularly me mum &#8211; favored the goddess Karamesis&#8230; the goddess of ribbon and bunting. And home decor, I think. Me, I went through the whole rebellion phase, and one day I heard about Pokmor Xang, and started worshiping him. On a lark, you know?</p><p><strong>Rampant Coyote:</strong> So it wasn&#8217;t serious?</p><p><strong>Birz Flemmins:</strong> Naw, not at first, no. But it got me parents&#8217; underclothes in a wad, so I was happy enough about that.</p><p><strong>Rampant Coyote:</strong> So how did you go from that to becoming an actual priest of Pokmor Xang?</p><p><strong>Birz Flemmins:</strong> We was in town at the market and I heard a man actually preaching about Pokmor Xang. It caught me fancy, so I listened. That man was Kratic Barg, the founder of the New Pokmor Xang Movement. Wot he said made sense to me.  Plus, he offered free donuts. Mainly the donuts.</p><p><strong>Rampant Coyote:</strong> What did he say?</p><p><strong>Birz Flemmins:</strong> Oh, he went on about bringing Pokmor Xang out of obscurity, and that the god&#8217;s gratitude for the restoration of his religion would know no bounds. Since I had me a serious acne condition at the time, I figured I could use all the help I could get. And dark powers of magic sounded pretty fun, too. Plus, me parents were pretty anxious to get me apprenticed out of the house. Partly because they were sick of me burning the appropriate incense to Pokmor Xang on our porch.  And they&#8217;d given up hope of me bein&#8217; much good at anything else. So I signed on right then as Barg&#8217;s apprentice, and never went home again.</p><p>Barg taught us that wot we needed was a good &#8220;Public Relations&#8221; campaign for Pokmor Xang. He chucked the old-fashioned boil-ridden demon iconography and stuff like that, and instead used the happy Pokmor Xang wit&#8217; the greasy breakfast image.  He also taught that people would respect and fear us when we displayed true power, and that would make all the difference and make us a major religion. Oh, and the occasional human sacrifice. Barg told us that nobody takes a dark religion seriously unless they hold the occasional human sacrifice.</p><p><strong>Rampant Coyote:</strong> So were you there when he established the temple near Ardin?</p><p><strong>Birz Flemmins:</strong> Oh, yeah. It was actually a former lizard-man temple of some ugly demon decades earlier. I guess some adventurers had raided THAT temple back before I was born, and killed all the lizard men. But Barg said that was perfect, as it still had some of it&#8217;s old dark mojo that would aid us in our work.</p><p>Lookin&#8217; back, I guess knowin&#8217; that the previous temple had been raided and all the inhabitants killed should have been a tip-off that it weren&#8217;t gonna end well.</p><p><strong>Rampant Coyote:</strong> What was your greatest accomplishment in your time with the temple of Pokmor Xang?</p><p><strong>Birz Flemmins:</strong> I&#8217;m pretty proud of the year or so I spent collecting pus to create the pus golems. You have no idea how challenging that was.</p><p><strong>Rampant Coyote:</strong> I&#8217;m afraid to ask&#8230;</p><p><strong>Birz Flemmins:</strong> You gotta secretly infect a town wit&#8217; contagious boils.  Then you come into town a few days later pretending to be some kind of healer.</p><p><strong>Rampant Coyote:</strong> I think I&#8217;m going to be sick.</p><p><strong>Birz Flemmins:</strong> Too late, I&#8217;m retired, find yer own damn healer.</p><p><strong> Rampant Coyote:</strong> Uh&#8230;. where was I? The masks! What was it with the masks?</p><p><strong>Birz Flemmins:</strong> They&#8217;re traditional, I hear. Plus they had an herbal compartment in the nose.</p><p><strong>Rampant Coyote:</strong> Herbal compartment?</p><p><strong>Birz Flemmins:</strong> For strong herbs. You work wit&#8217; rancid pus every day, you need something to block the smell.</p><p><strong>Rampant Coyote:</strong> Uh&#8230;. yeah. Okay.</p><p><strong>Birz Flemmins:</strong> Believe me, lookin&#8217; at some o&#8217; my fellow priests &#8211; the masks were an improvement.</p><p><strong>Rampant Coyote:</strong> How did you survive the adventurer assault?</p><p><strong>Birz Flemmins:</strong> I was out in another town collectin&#8217; more pus to make golems. Had two barrels of the stuff. Came back to the temple a week after the attack, and the place smelled worse than ever.</p><p><strong>Rampant Coyote:</strong> So what have you been doing since?</p><p><strong>Birz Flemmins:</strong> I been keepin&#8217; busy.  Got a job as a thug, breakin&#8217; arms and legs and stuff. It&#8217;s fulfilling. I still use my powers sometimes, too. I earn extra money on weekends entertaining at children&#8217;s birthday parties. Also, I heard that there&#8217;s a job opening up in an army of evil that&#8217;s s&#8217;posed to take over the world sometime soon, and they need evil priests. I figure I could apply for that.</p><p><strong>Rampant Coyote:</strong> Any regrets?</p><p><strong>Birz Flemmins:</strong> Only that I ain&#8217;t been able to get revenge on the bastards wot raided the temple.  Someday, I figger. Maybe wit&#8217; that evil army.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

All-digital distribution? All titles with &#8220;free-to-play&#8221; modes? Okay,  sign me up!</p><p>But now we have indies on the consoles. And perhaps, with the next-gen consoles and their concerns about a failing business model (and the fairly spectacular rise of indie gaming from obscurity to&#8230; well, something less obscure), might the indies be treated as something better than third-class citizens on the new big-name consoles? Will it be just as easy (or just as hard) to bring <strong>Frayed Knights 2</strong> onto the newest XBox and the PS4 as on the Ouya?</p><p>If I knew the answers, I&#8217;d probably be rich.</p><p>Instead, I&#8217;m just looking forward to goofing around on a strange game new console.</p>

It was inspired a little by collectable trading card games. Not that I&#8217;m turning an RPG into a CCG, but when a single player is playing a group of characters I started envisioning it a little bit more like choosing an action out of a &#8220;hand&#8221; of options.</p><p>There&#8217;s still a lot under construction, but the initial prognosis is&#8230; promising. Very promising. No doubt there&#8217;s a lot of work to do on the balancing front, but so far, given relatively few rules, it&#8217;s looking good.</p><p>One aspect of making the spells was to make them sound over-the-top, a little like spells from old-school Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Tunnels &amp; Trolls, or the original release of Hackmaster. I think I succeeded. Here are some of my favorites:</p><p>&#8220;Baba Yaga&#8217;s Unbelievable Armor Intensification&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Primordial Magic Defense Impairment of Ariel&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Underwhelming Revival&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Fangal&#8217;s Cryptic Magic Defense Bonus&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Arkan&#8217;s Introductory Magic Defense Failure&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Sufficient Vim&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Cleansing of Apuleius&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Penelope&#8217;s Occult Boon&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Oakfather&#8217;s Empowerment&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Wimpy Spellwipe&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Wussy Crawl&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Worthy Armor Restriction&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Brutus&#8217;s Explosive Core Punishment&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Zalem&#8217;s Unfathomable Spiky Devastation&#8221;</p><p>I&#8217;ll tell ya &#8211; I want to use <em>Zalem&#8217;s Unfathomable Spiky Devastation</em> just based on the name. (For the record, it&#8217;s a Sorcerer spell that does piercing damage to a single target). Sadly, the random tables are pretty large, so the chances I&#8217;ll ever see that spell again are almost non-existent. To be honest, I learned quite a few new words as I was putting together the tables. I&#8217;d never even heard the word, &#8220;caliginous&#8221; before (and it still fails my spell-checker).  Pretty cool stuff, really. I learned a lot of new words reading Gary Gygax&#8217;s text back when I was a kid, too.</p><p>Although if I decide to localize for other languages, I&#8217;ve got some serious challenges in hand.</p><p>Of course, amusing-but-plausible spell names are only a tiny part of the equation. Most of the magic of the magic system, so to speak, comes from the formulas that make it work, and how they work with the rest of the system. Now, as far as balancing is concerned, we won&#8217;t know &#8220;for sure&#8221; until we&#8217;re deep into testing. But since it&#8217;s all based on what worked and was (reasonably) balanced in FK1, I think we&#8217;re going to at least start out in the same ballpark.</p><p>Since the action system has been completely redone from the ground up, there are a few things that may need addressing. For example, in FK1, all &#8220;Mass&#8221; spells (which affected an entire group) required the use of a spellstone. They were just too powerful without that limiting factor, even with a high endurance cost.  Now, although they currently still have a spellstone cost, mass / group spells also require a higher action tier, which slows down their use. Will that be enough to balance them all by itself? I&#8217;m not sure.</p><p>In FK1, I had never-exercised code that also handled &#8216;rank&#8217; area effects &#8211; a spell that could effect all enemies within a single rank (distance). All two of them, max, as it turns out.  But as the list of spells started getting out of control, I realized there was just not enough room for it, so no spells took advantage of it.  But now it&#8217;s entirely possible to generate all kinds of potential spells, and let players mix and match their &#8220;optimum loadout&#8221; for whatever situations they can expect.  In addition to &#8220;rank&#8221; based area effect, there are more: &#8220;Penetrating&#8221; area effects that actually affect creatures behind your target.  Then there&#8217;s &#8220;explosive,&#8221; which might be the most challenging one to balance. It&#8217;s sort of a lower-strength &#8220;Mass&#8221; spell effect:  The primary target gets hit with the full effect, and all other members of the target&#8217;s group get hit with reduced versions of the effects. Then there are &#8220;self-only&#8221; spells. These spells can&#8217;t be targeted and only affect the caster&#8230; but they are more powerful than normal.</p><p>A spell can have up to three effects of various kinds. Effects are broken into offensive and defensive types, and all effects must be of the same type. So you can&#8217;t have a spell that simultaneously damages opponents and increases your party&#8217;s speed. So far, that seems to be a restriction that is workable.</p><p>I&#8217;ve also gotten rid of some damage types.  Disease, sonic, water-based, and a few other lesser- or never-used (in FK1) damage types have gone away. Disease is now represented by status conditions.  That still leaves plenty of damage types &#8211; edged, piercing, priestly, fire, frost, shocking, poison, etc.</p><p>I&#8217;ve also limited spell enhancements to only three levels, instead of five as in the first game. I figure, with all these gazillions of potential spells out there, there&#8217;s no need to press one into higher-level service for a long time. And with that in mind, I also changed the rules somewhat about what the spell enhancements really do.  I figure that if you are gonna dump spellstones into enhancing a spell&#8217;s power, it should be really over-the-top.  Previously, in FK1, if the enhancement took the spell over your normal &#8220;spellcasting level&#8221;, you could not cast it with that enhancement. In FK2, that restriction has been lifted&#8230;  In fact, the primary use of spell enhancements is to &#8220;overcharge&#8221; a spell to something normally beyond your power to apply.  In addition to increasing the spell&#8217;s effective power level, enhancements also increase the &#8216;magical attack&#8217; rating &#8211; making them less likely to miss.  So enhancements are really there when you absolutely, postively have to kill it this round!</p><p>As I previously discussed &#8211; the dynamically generated spells are mixed in with standard and &#8220;common&#8221; spells. Common spells are always there, automatically in the spellbook for casters of a certain level and proficiency (and the right feats).  These are bread-and-butter spells of a particular casting field. Fireballs for wizards, heals for divine clerics.  Then there are also &#8220;Standard&#8221; spells, spells which are not automatically available, but are still &#8220;fixed&#8221; and guaranteed to be available somewhere in the game.  Many of these will have unique special effects, and will often be &#8220;overpowered&#8221; compared to the common and dynamically generated spells. This is where things like &#8220;<em>Power Word: Defenestrate</em>&#8221; live.</p><p>It&#8217;s certainly different.  But as the system has taken form, I&#8217;m growing more confident this will all work.</p>

A nice blend of cycles keeps the game varied and interesting. You&#8217;ve got the combat cycles &#8211; nice, repeating elements that (hopefully!) stay varied enough between different enemies and growing player character power and varying resources that it&#8217;s never a complete repetition. And of course, the character growth and loot cycles.  And bits of exposition (not really a cycle) to keep the context changing.</p><p><a href=\"http://rampantgames.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/trekenterprise.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-5680\" alt=\"trekenterprise\" src=\"http://rampantgames.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/trekenterprise-300x168.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"168\" align=\"right\" hspace=\"9\" vspace=\"4\" /></a>For me, exploration is a major element of CRPGs. The whole Star Trek opening monologue captures the spirit of adventure for me. Sure, there may be swashbuckling or grim battles to fight and fantastic loot to be acquired, and of course expertise to be gained &#8211; but those are all secondary, or at least co-equal, to the feeling of exploration for me. Even if the entire game takes place within the well-trodden streets of a city, where I&#8217;m boldly going where many-a-person has gone before, I want find secrets, surprises, and wonder around every corner. Maybe that&#8217;s a projection of my optimism for the real world into games, but that&#8217;s how I am.</p><p>Of course, those efforts must be rewarded. If you play a (well-designed) RPG in the style of 16-bit JRPGs, you&#8217;ll often find that almost every extended &#8220;dead-end&#8221; path terminates with a chest with a treasure in it. It may not make much sense from a realism perspective, but as a game mechanic, it rewards thorough exploration. This also extends the game (from a development perspective), as this kind of &#8220;content&#8221; is pretty easy to generate, and causes the player not only to consume this &#8220;cheap&#8221; content. It also slows the play down as the player actively hunts for these kinds of rewards, making the game longer. Overdo it, and it becomes boring &#8220;filler.&#8221; But done right, it&#8217;s fun stuff that rewards careful, exploration-based gameplay.</p><p>But there should be a lot more than that. More to do than just wander down side paths, and more to the rewards than just chests with a bonus potion.</p><p>The trick in CRPGs is that this kind of content gets EXPENSIVE. That&#8217;s a big part of the reason this genre of game is known to be a budget-breaker. And no, before you say it, purely dynamic content is not the answer. Maybe part of the answer (it certainly makes for interesting rewards, as Diablo-style games easily attest), but certainly not the whole answer. &#8216;Cuz basically, once you&#8217;ve gotten a feel for the formulas at work, exploring dynamically generated environments has only slightly more excitement than hunting down prime numbers in math.</p><p><a href=\"http://rampantgames.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/searching.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-5679\" alt=\"searching\" src=\"http://rampantgames.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/searching-214x300.jpg\" width=\"214\" height=\"300\" align=\"left\" hspace=\"9\" vspace=\"4\" /></a>I just thought I&#8217;d break down a bunch of ideas &#8211; most of which have appeared in some CRPGs in the past (especially if you include <a href=\"http://frayedknights.com\">Frayed Knights </a>- I experimented with a few of ideas for that) &#8211; for both the different ways you can explore content &#8211; adding extra dimensions to the exploration gameplay cycle, and for the kinds of rewards that can be obtained for doing so.</p><p>Adding depth to the exploration mechanic can be a little perilous. It&#8217;s not hard for things to get bogged down this way, particularly if it involves returning to previously-explored areas (backtracking) in a large game-world with slow navigation, or if the system is too plodding and methodical. (Yeah, I know, I&#8217;m working on improving that with FK2 searches). These should be recurring mechanics in the game &#8211; not only does that economize on content &amp; code creation (you don&#8217;t want to spend so much time on a one-off effect, do you?), but it also then provides a &#8220;skill&#8221; for the player (not the character) to learn and master &#8211; recognizing and acting on these opportunities. Here are a handful of ideas:</p><p>Here are some ideas for layers / depth / interaction to the exploration mechanic, or in many cases to create obstacles or puzzles to free navigation. Some are pretty common, others &#8211; not so much:</p><p>#1 &#8211; Movement &#8211; you go somewhere and something happens.</p><p>#2 &#8211; Interaction &#8211; you must click on something to explore what it does / says</p><p>#3 &#8211; Hidden interaction. Like #2 but it&#8217;s not obvious &#8211; like a secret door, or a sword tucked away in the corner. Care must be taken to make sure these aren&#8217;t TOO hidden, or the game becomes a &#8220;hunt the pixel&#8221; exercise.</p><p>#4 &#8211; Use a skill or ability or a tool (item) in a particular spot to reveal a secret &#8211; for example, Mario ducking on pipes to discover the ones with &#8220;secrets&#8221; in Super Mario Brothers</p><p>#5 &#8211; Using a skill or ability or a tool (item) in a particular spot to reach an otherwise unattainable location.</p><p>#6 &#8211; Illusionary obstacles &#8211; like an illusionary wall or a hidden bridge across a chasm.</p><p>#7 &#8211; Destroyable obstacles. Particularly ones that can&#8217;t be destroyed by chopping at it with a hand weapon.</p><p>#8 &#8211; Sequences of actions done in a particular spot &#8211; these are usually either explained to the player or strongly hinted at.</p><p>#9 &#8211; Luring a computer-controlled entity (example: NPC, enemy, or a trap effect) to unlock the environment in a way the player cannot by himself.</p><p>#10 &#8211; The world / information / rewards change with time &#8211; perhaps as the game progresses, with the seasons, or just time of day. Silent villagers during the day are talkative at night, moongates shift position and destination based on phases of the moon, etc.  Or as a really weird idea, what if the player could experience &#8220;flashbacks&#8221; in various locations to what happened at an earlier time as they learn more about the world?</p><p>#11 &#8211; New ability reveals all-new information / objects / alternate versions of the world. Maybe a dog added to the party can &#8220;see&#8221; smells that were previously invisible, or the player character can &#8220;phase shift&#8221; into a shadowy unpopulated alternate dimension version of the same world.</p><p>#12 &#8211; Proximity Clues &#8211; the player is not given the exact location of what they are looking for, but may explore with hints revealing either the approximate location (maybe an area to be searched), or as in <strong>Frayed Knights</strong>, updates as to whether you are getting &#8220;warmer&#8221; or &#8220;colder&#8221; as you search.</p><p>#13 &#8211; Need special equipment or vehicle to pass &#8211; perhaps scuba gear to explore an underwater area, or a magic carpet to fly over an impassible mountain range. This differs from #5 in that it&#8217;s not a specific action done in a particular location, but rather the possession (or equipping) of the item allows access to all terrain of of this kind.</p><p>#14 &#8211; A physical or mental puzzle is required to explore deeper. <strong>Dungeon Master</strong> style games &#8211; like the recent <strong>Legend of Grimrock</strong> &#8211; are full of these.</p><p>#15 -Counters. While it&#8217;s very &#8220;gamey,&#8221; having a running counter of the number of undiscovered secrets (possibly broken down by type) can help motivate players and also let them know when to quit digging around every nook and cranny.  Ideally, these would be explained through some kind of mechanic that makes sense within the context of the world, but even a totally external mechanic is often better than nothing, depending upon the style of game.</p><p>#16 &#8211; Mood / Reputation / Faction / Alignment / Progress shifts  &#8211; the world (or at least the willingness of people to talk about it and give you access to areas and information) changes based on cumulative shifts instigated by the player. Perhaps as you gain the trust of certain villagers, they become more forthcoming with key bits of information. Or efforts to repair flooding throughout the city and direct the flow of water unblocks or reveals new paths.</p><p>Okay, there&#8217;s a dozen (Update: I went back and exceeded my dozen. Feature creep!)  ideas for making exploring an environment more interesting. Not all are great, and that&#8217;s really just scratching the surface. Hopefully, for RPG designers out there (especially the aspiring / beginning ones), those will at least start you thinking. Now here are a dozen ideas for rewards:</p><p><a href=\"http://rampantgames.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Adventure_Easteregg.png\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-5681\" alt=\"Adventure_Easteregg\" src=\"http://rampantgames.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Adventure_Easteregg-300x187.png\" width=\"300\" height=\"187\" /></a>#1 &#8211; Exploration is its own reward. Sometimes &#8211; and this is very occasionally, and really depends on the game &#8211; just seeing something cool is good enough. Like an &#8220;easter egg.&#8221;</p><p>#2 &#8211; Loot. Yeah. This is done a lot. As this is frequently optional, this is usually one of the more expendable / cumulative resources rather than a major permanent item.</p><p>#3 &#8211; Story Rewards. Doling out a little extra optional exposition might not thrill all players, but the RPG players tend to be the kind that enjoy this kind of thing.</p><p>#4 &#8211; Clues / Hints to more locations to explore or ways to circumvent their challenges. Yes, this reward for exploration encourages&#8230; MORE exploration.</p><p>#5 &#8211; New environments. The classic Super Mario Brothers &#8220;Secret World&#8221; reward. These are obviously expensive for developers to make, but the promise of a few of these scattered throughout the world can make exploration REALLY exciting.</p><p>#6 &#8211; A bonus quest</p><p>#7 &#8211; A potential new NPC companion</p><p>#8 &#8211; An experience point award. Minor, but cool.</p><p>#9 &#8211; A challenging optional puzzle or combat encounter (with its own reward).</p><p>#10 &#8211; A location that can recharge player resources &#8211; like a fountain that restores health or magic points, or a merchant.</p><p>#11 &#8211; A hint, strategy, or action that can be taken to make an upcoming &#8220;boss&#8221; encounter easier.  This is, IMO, a far more exciting way of rewarding careful players than simply making their brute-force abilities more potent (with more potions, XP for the treadmill, etc.). I did this a few times in <a href=\"http://frayedknights.com\"><strong>Frayed Knights: The Skull of S&#8217;makh &#8211; Daon</strong></a>&#8230; you could bypass the a big chunk of the dungeon and go straight to the boss, or you could explore and deprive the boss of power or reinforcements.</p><p>#12 &#8211; A piece of a bigger reward or puzzle gets exposed.</p><p>#13 &#8211; Reputation / Vanity award &#8211; because of what you have explored or done,  other characters react to you differently based on the news. This can either be a one-time specific reward, or add towards a cumulative &#8220;reputation&#8221; score.</p><p>#14 &#8211; Customization options &#8211; this provides no actual gameplay reward, but gives the player the addition of new visuals, sounds, or whatnot to make their character unique.</p><p>#15 &#8211; Cumulative Story Progression &#8211; maybe you need to achieve a certain number or percentage of exploration-based goals to progress a story or quest. Beware &#8211; done poorly, this can lead to a boring &#8220;Kill ten rats&#8221; type of goal.</p><p>#16 &#8211; Unlocking of certain other obstacles. A tried and true variation.</p><p>Again, there are probably an infinite number of permutations, alternatives, and combinations of these ideas that can help make a more interesting RPG that relies upon more than simply beating the snot out of bad guys.</p>

Over the last several years, I have been paying less attention to the mainstream press. I mean, thank goodness for Rock Paper Shotgun and The Escapist for helping heal the hole left in my heart by Computer Gaming World.</p><p>I don&#8217;t get it. I mean, yeah, I understand the reasons, and I see them in action when I&#8217;m paying attention. And I can also see how it can become a vicious cycle. That kind of hostility can cause all camps into even more of a bunker-like mentality. As they hunker down with more anonymity, less mutual discussion, and less transparency, it can exacerbate the problems. We&#8217;re simultaneously too familiar with each other and yet not familiar enough to have a mutual respect. Or something.</p><p>But I still don&#8217;t understand the mentality. I mean, this is the <em>games</em> industry, right? All about fun? It should be a happy place!</p><p>In part, I think it may be because the gaming &#8220;industry&#8221; has grown so large and there&#8217;s so much money involve. Back when gaming was still largely a hobby.  When I first started subscribing to Computer Gaming World &#8211; back when I was a student and had trouble paying the subscription cost, not to mention new games &#8211; the gaming &#8220;industry&#8221; felt like it was hitting its stride, emerging from the shaky widespread hobby status of the 1980s into an actual industry. I remember the big discovery that the games business was finally bigger than Hollywood (if you constrained measurements to things like Box Office and video sales).</p><p>The thing was &#8211; we were all on the same side. Game developers were making games for gamers, and the press was a cheerleader for the hobby if not for individual games. News cycles were slower, games distribution channels weren&#8217;t so saturated, and it was okay to wait a few weeks for the reviews to come in before picking up a game. And gamers &#8211; well, they didn&#8217;t actually have much of a voice, other than letters to the editor and to the publishers, or by becoming game developers themselves (but who in their right mind would do that?!?!). It was too much work to be a troll. And I think there was more of a recognition of the limitations of games and game developers. And really, games and the underlying technology were so primitive that I think gamers knew there were limitations to their expectations. Finding a bug was more of a source of amusement than a source of nerdrage (unless it really screwed up your saved game, in which case full hulk-out mode was still an option).</p><p>If things are getting much worse, as an indie, if I&#8217;m not paying attention, it&#8217;s easy for me to ignore it. Instead, as an indie, I get to &#8220;enjoy&#8221; the downside of those more &#8220;civil&#8221; times &#8211; tiny budgets, obscurity, etc. And all I can do is try to be optimistic and model the kinds of behavior I wish others would also exhibit.  And yeah, this probably dooms me to a career of (relative) obscurity.  And it doesn&#8217;t stop me from launching into an occasional tirade. But there are a few things I think we could do better:</p><p>Publishers &#8211; respect your customers. Don&#8217;t treat them as wallets with legs. Don&#8217;t throw so much B.S. around with your hype and excuses that you begin to believe it yourselves. The more impenetrable you seem, the louder people are going to shout in hopes that someone behind your walls might hear. And those will drown out the moderate voices.</p><p>Press &#8211; respect your audience. While I certainly understand your need to strike the iron at the hottest and the dot your site with linkbait articles, focus on the service you provide to your audience, not just on how you can get the most number of eyeballs to your ads. I&#8217;m really glad that Rock Paper Shotgun and The Escapist have done well, because those sites tend to model what I&#8217;d like to see in gaming journalism better, and it seems like much of the industry has taken notice and has started to follow suit. At least things seem better now than they were five years ago, when it was getting increasingly difficult to tell the difference between a fanboy&#8217;s rants and a &#8216;professional&#8217; article.</p><p>Gamers &#8211; depending on how thin-skinned they are, one negative comment has around five to twenty times the weight of a positive one to a developer. The end result of too much negativity (and out-and-out trolls) is that the ones you most desperately want to listen to you will begin to tune you out completely out of pure necessity. The Internet gives you a bigger voice than ever, so use it to provide as much positive and constructive feedback as possible, and do your best to police the trolls (and, for that matter, the useless fanboys) as possible. Shame the hyperbole, praise the efforts to keep things down to earth and constructive. And try to remember to comment when you are pleased with things as much as when you are pissed off about something, because most of the time the people who are motivated to write are the ones who are angry about something. Help provide balance.</p><p>Developers &#8211; it can be hard to provide transparency when you are desperately meeting deadlines and bound by publishing contract restrictions and wary of undermining marketing efforts by admitting that maybe your upcoming project really isn&#8217;t the biggest thing since the invention of the light bulb.  But do what you can. While there&#8217;s a certain percentage of the population that are real-life griefers,  I believe that when your average (grown-up) gamer sees the effort that real human beings are making on products, they tend to be more empathetic and understanding.</p><p>Respect. And keeping it real. That&#8217;s really what it comes down to.</p>

It&#8217;s not got that kind of top-shelf budget (in the eight-figure range in U.S. dollars) that a publisher would put into a <strong>Call of Duty</strong> or <strong>Tomb Raider</strong>.  But it&#8217;s still a big project. We&#8217;ll know more this weekend, as it is being presented at PAX East.</p><p>What this really means to me is a confirmation of the crap I was saying on Monday &#8211; <a href=\"http://rampantgames.com/blog/?p=5639\">&#8220;Old School&#8221; is  back, baby</a>.  Which kinda makes the term irrelevant, since it soon won&#8217;t be so &#8220;old&#8221; anymore. I don&#8217;t expect it to replace the newer styles of games at all. With games like <strong>Mass Effect</strong> and <strong>Skyrim</strong> and <strong>Diablo III</strong> making money hand over fist, those aren&#8217;t going away either.  We&#8217;re just (&#8220;just?&#8221;) experiencing another renaissance of RPGs.</p><p>I can&#8217;t get over how awesome this is.</p><p>Okay &#8211; now, this does have one itsy bitsy potentially negative impact. It means that after all my efforts as an indie to make the kinds of games the big publishers have ignored, I&#8217;ll now be competing far more &#8216;head-to-head&#8217; than I ever anticipated. I mean, this is a dusting-off of one the classics that inspired <strong>Frayed Knights</strong> in the first place. How do I compete with that?</p><p>Amusingly enough, I&#8217;m the opposite of worried. I think it&#8217;s awesome. Yeah, production-value wise, there&#8217;s no way I can go head-to-head on production values. Even if their budget is &#8220;only&#8221; a couple of million dollars, that&#8217;s astronomically more than my shoestring budget. But as all of you who have played the first game can attest &#8211; <strong>Frayed Knights</strong> is a totally different game than those that inspired it.  I&#8217;m already stepping up my game on the sequels, and so while I may not be able to be quite as pretty, I&#8217;m pretty sure I can take &#8216;em on the gameplay front.</p><p>But I really don&#8217;t expect it to be an either / or thing. I think as &#8220;competition&#8221; goes, as long as I don&#8217;t release FK2 within two weeks of this game, it&#8217;s actually going to be beneficial. All this really does is validate the market and hopefully bring more attention to this style of game. I feel it can only help my sales.</p><p>In other words:</p><p><em>BRING IT ON!</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p>

The quote that caused the fuss was, <em>“But other than a few exceptions, like Chris Roberts, I’ve met virtually no one in our industry who I think is close to as good a game designer as I am. I’m not saying that because I think I’m so brilliant. What I’m saying is, I think most game designers really just suck, and I think there’s a reason why.”</em></p><p>The reason, he went on to explain, was that game designers typically have no other skills. The ones with artistic skills become artists. The ones with programming skills become programmers. The ones who can&#8217;t do anything else but still want to make games become testers and /or designers. To exaggerate things a little further, he added “<em>And every designer that I work with—all throughout life—I think, frankly, is lazy</em>.”</p><p>Now, tempering his comments, he was explaining how everyone he hired <em>except</em> designers was better than he was. Artists, composers, even (now) programmers.  And you know, I can see that. It&#8217;s also something that can be pretty subjective to measure. (UPDATE: He&#8217;s also released an article to clarify his comments &#8211; <a href=\"http://www.portalarium.com/images/docs/Words%20Taken%20Out%20of%20Context.pdf\">you can read the PDF clarification here</a>.)</p><p>The thing that honked me off was the, &#8220;<em>virtually no one in our industry who I think is close to as good a game designer as I am.</em>&#8221; That really went overboard, and my initial reaction was not good. Dude, I love your older games and stuff, and I was quick to throw some gambling money towards <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/portalarium/shroud-of-the-avatar-forsaken-virtues-0\">your Kickstarter</a>, and I&#8217;ve read Shay Addam&#8217;s book about you and the creation of the first <strong>Ultima</strong>s like six times, and I credit you with being perhaps the single greatest influence on my career in game development. But when I ask what you&#8217;ve done for me lately, I have to go back about twenty years.  I&#8217;m willing to cut you some slack because you&#8217;ve had corporate overlords exerting control over you since then. <strong>Shroud of the Avatar</strong> is your chance to prove yourself.  Please be awesome.</p><p>But let&#8217;s get back to that Corporate Overlord thing in a minute.</p><p>Now, <strong>Ultima Online</strong> was arguably a big success story, it&#8217;s just that the reality of it never appealed to me as much as the idea of it when it was in development.  I&#8217;m happy to argue that the uneven track record by this guy who was such an inspiration to me can be blamed on his lack of creative control. The corporate overlords made demands, and he had to work within an imposed framework (schedule, style, etc.) that might have been detrimental to good game design. I&#8217;m completely on board with this, &#8216;cuz I&#8217;ve seen it. All the time. Because guess what <em>EVERY OTHER NON-INDIE GAME DESIGNER IN THE INDUSTRY HAS TO DEAL WITH?</em> That&#8217;s right &#8211; lack of creative control. Corporate Overlords dictating the details.  Even the ones you personally hired&#8230;</p><p>So no, it&#8217;s not really laziness. It&#8217;s disempowerment.</p><p>When I first started in the games biz, I was hired as a programmer. I really wanted to be a designer. Because like every game fan who has never actually designed a commercial, released game before, I thought I was a really awesome designer. I had a lot to learn just to discover how much there was to learn! My company, Singletrac, was new to making games, and didn&#8217;t really understand the role of a game designer, either. So we also put them up on a pedestal, at least initially. As they probably should be.</p><p>Then we discovered that the rest of the industry didn&#8217;t treat designers that way. And that what I, and most non-developers, assumed a designer was supposed to do was&#8230; well, not wrong, but certainly not conforming to reality. Over time, I discovered the reasons why. I remember attending a great lecture At GDC one year by a designer who&#8217;d worked at LucasArts and Microprose. He explained how a large part of a game designer&#8217;s job was a glorified spreadsheet maintainer. A mercenary. (In fact, I think the lecture was entitled, &#8220;The Game Designer as a Mercenary.&#8221;)</p><p>As it turns out, as time and game development processes have changed, even that was probably elevated.</p><p>See, game design IS hard.  But since it&#8217;s not a technical skill like programming or art, you can fake it on the cheap. That&#8217;s what ends up happening. Modern game designers aren&#8217;t usually paid to &#8220;push the needle.&#8221; Oh, lip service may be paid to that, and they may bear that responsibility when the game is in danger of being canceled, but they aren&#8217;t really given the authority to back that up.  Publishers today play it safe, particularly when AAA-level budgets are in question, and they have teams of specialist designers who are paid to work long hours attending meetings and sit in their cubicles churning out scenarios and defining features that I once heard described as &#8220;checkbox innovation&#8221; &#8211; you know, checking off the list of features on the back of the box. A designer who goes out on a limb to try and change things is probably going to find himself out of a job. Good luck finding a new one when your degree is in &#8220;game design.&#8221; That&#8217;s a specialist skillset, and the industry is happy to abuse that fact.</p><p>And yeah, Garriott is probably right. A lot of these guys and girls aren&#8217;t necessarily the best game designers in the world. They may not even be better than the programmer or artist the next cubicle over. Instead, they are the <em>low-cost provider</em> of game design services.  Which, in the video games factory model, is how they are supposed to function.</p><p>And before you get too incensed at how the AAA industry undervalues game designers, look at your own purchasing habits. How many sequels to best-selling franchises do you own? The market doesn&#8217;t tend to reward the innovators. Yes, occasionally the universe rewards the Notches of the world, but as a rule, these big publishers that I refer to as &#8220;corporate overlords&#8221; got to be big and powerful by executing exactly on the strategy the market tends to reward &#8212; playing it safe with game design, and throwing the money at production values instead. The Michael Bays of the gaming industry continue to earn top dollar making more, bigger explosions, while the innovators struggle to get noticed.</p><p>It sucks. But it&#8217;s the way it is.</p><p>I&#8217;ve known several professional (non-indie) game designers, and while many could be described as &#8220;foot soldiers for the games industry&#8221; as <a href=\"http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/131256/an_interview_with_chris_crawford.php\">Chris Crawford once suggested</a>, there are many that are passionate about games and would dearly love to &#8220;move the needle&#8221; on game design and long to do something cool with the medium. Some adapt, and do their professional best to meet the demands of the corporate overlords. I admire them for what they do, even if it may not be the role they originally envisioned for themselves as a &#8220;game designer.&#8221;</p><p>But several them eventually graduate from the mainstream industry and become indies&#8230;</p>

The press. He&#8217;s been doing this for about twelve years, at several different websites and now as editor-in-chief of True PC Gaming for the last two, and while he couldn&#8217;t speak for all game journalists and gaming website / magazine editors, he had twenty-five minutes of pretty dense, valuable information for both new and veteran indies.</p><p>I took copious notes, but I am not sure if he&#8217;s going to be offering the presentation himself online or not, so I&#8217;ll just summarize. Here were a few of his major points:</p><p>#1 &#8211; Be professional in your communications. This means make it concise, use proper grammar and spelling, and treat it as a professional business. If you don&#8217;t take it seriously, and write like you are just some kid making games in his parents&#8217; basement, they won&#8217;t take you seriously. He says he honestly tries to read every email that he&#8217;s sent, but he gets a TON of email, and a ton of press releases, and if one is just too painful to read&#8230; he might not.</p><p>#2 &#8211; Be enthusiastic. This is marketing. You need to market to whomever is reading your press release, which means you need to get them emotionally invested and ready to commit to action in that one or two minutes you have their attention. This means you need to be confident and enthusiastic about the product, tell a good story, include screenshots (you&#8217;d be surprised by the number of indies who fail to do this!), include a link to a demo AND, if possible, a link to a review copy IN THE EMAIL. If they need to send another email to you and lose a day in communication waiting for a response for more info, things may get forgotten.</p><p>#3 &#8211; Don&#8217;t be intimidated. It doesn&#8217;t matter how big they are, or how many hits their websites get, or how famous they are in the gaming circles &#8211; nor does it matter how insignificant you, the indie developer, are. After all, you actually make games&#8230; all they can do is talk about other people&#8217;s games. That&#8217;s really cool. But we all put our pants on one leg at a time (except for those of us who wear kilts or skirts, I guess&#8230;). Be respectful, and expect the same treatment.</p><p>#4 &#8211; Be confident and persistent. Nobody can prevent you from being a success but yourself. People will mock you, people will tell you that you can&#8217;t do it, and that&#8217;s just the nature of the business and the Internet. But ultimately, tell yourself &#8211; why CAN&#8217;T you make the next <strong>Minecraft</strong>? Why can&#8217;t the next big indie success story be yours? Keep at it, and don&#8217;t listen to the naysayers. Failures may happen, but they are never permanent unless you quit.</p><p>Okay, after that, we broke off to play games. Well, in theory.</p><p>I did see the recently-released (on iPhone, which I don&#8217;t have) <a href=\"http://logicdrillgames.com/games/bullet-train-hell/\"><strong>Bullet Train Hell</strong></a>. What&#8217;s funny is I thought this game was release-worthy months ago. I&#8217;m kinda surprised it&#8217;s only now been released. But seriously &#8211; it&#8217;s polished and awesome. If you have an iPhone, pick this one up. It&#8217;ll be out for the Ouya soon, and I am snagging it as a day one purchase. And I&#8217;m not even much of a puzzle-platform game kinda guy. But besides it being a local indie&#8217;s game, it&#8217;s really fun, clever, cool, polished, and challenging.</p><p><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/sQDGWEnni4g\" height=\"360\" width=\"640\" allowfullscreen=\" \" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p><p>Another really awesome-looking game was not a video game at all &#8211; but a collectable-card-game merged with a tactical war game. Entitled <a href=\"http://warcommand.com/\">War Command,</a> it started life as a playable paper prototype for a CCG-style game for handhelds and other platforms. But after some success at a local board game convention, they&#8217;ve been convinced to make it a physical product as well.</p><p>This is cool. I hope it succeeds.</p><p>By request, I also showed <strong>Frayed Knights: The Skull of S&#8217;makh-Daon</strong> at the tail end of the night.</p><p>I missed most of the other games. I will call my excuse &#8220;networking.&#8221; Yeah. That&#8217;s my story and I&#8217;m sticking to it. I talked with a lot of people. And I left energized.</p><p>One thing about the smartphone / tablet revolution and the changing face of indie gaming is that it is turning out a lot of veterans of the indie gaming scene in a hurry. My games are too big, and I move too slow, to keep up on what&#8217;s going in this business. I&#8217;m finding that the opportunity to talk with others helps me keep a finger on the pulse of things. I love chatting with other indies, finding out what they are doing, what tools they are using, what experiences they are having making and releasing their games, and so on.</p><p>I&#8217;m really glad we get to do this.</p>

Instead, I want to talk about the demise of LucasArts. You can skip down to the end for details, but basically – I want to hear about your favorite LucasArts game in the comments.</p><p><strong>R.I.P. LucasArts</strong></p><p>I think it was a bookstore where I first saw some games proudly displaying the logo for “LucasFilm Games.” <strong>Ballblazer</strong> and <strong>Rescue on Fractalis</strong>, I think they were. I couldn’t afford them, and knew little about them beyond the screenshots and text on the cardboard boxes, and to this day I have never played them. But at the time, my thought was, “AWESOME! George Lucas is making video games now!” Even at the time, I realized that the filmmaker was probably not sweating 6502 Assembly code or anything, but I did believe he’d be overseeing production in some capacity. Maybe he did, on those first games. I don’t know.</p><p>Eventually, LucasFilm Games became LucasArts, and through the 1990s they were a powerhouse. Many of their best games were actually created externally, through companies like Totally Games (<strong>X-Wing</strong> and <strong>TIE Fighter</strong>).  Formerly, Lawrence Holland had worked internally with LucasArts to create one of my favorite early flight sims (circa 1989), <strong>Their Finest Hour: the Battle of Britain</strong>. My favorite part of that game was actually the manual.  It remains one of the best-written game manuals of all time – a distinction that it is unlikely to lose in an era where <strong>Pong</strong>‘s instructions are likely to be bypassed by the TL;DR crowd. Half of the manual was a history of the war, complete with stories told by pilots who’d been on both sides of the battle.</p><p><strong><a href=\"http://rampantgames.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/x-wing.png\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-5741\" alt=\"x-wing\" src=\"http://rampantgames.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/x-wing.png\" width=\"320\" height=\"200\" align=\"left\" hspace=\"9\" vspace=\"4\" /></a>X-Wing</strong> was awesomeness surpassed only by the sequel <strong>TIE Fighter</strong>, but I still preferred the first game simply because it fulfilled a longstanding fantasy. I was a hardcore <strong>Wing Commander</strong> fan at the time, and the two games were very different in style. I was trying to explain to a friend (and fellow <strong>X-Wing</strong> addict) about how I’d like to blend the strengths of the two games, and she shook her head and explained, “For you, <strong>X-Wing</strong> is a game. For me, it’s more of a religion.”</p><p>Another great movie tie-in title that I loved was <strong>Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis</strong>. It was a wonderful blend of Monkey Island style humor and adventure-gamey goodness, coupled with an all-new adventure for the bullwhip-wielding hero, which as far as I’m concerned might as well be canon. After all, it was better than that <em>Crystal Skull</em> movie… Actually, IMO it was better than all but the first movie.</p><p>Embarrassingly, I’ve never played <strong>Day of the Tentacle</strong> or <strong>Maniac Mansion</strong>. That may be grounds for evicting me from the adventure gaming fan club, but I can at least say I’ve seen good portions of both games being played. Really, <strong>Loom</strong> was my introduction to the graphic adventure games of the 1990s – which I sadly finished in only two days (and could have finished in a single day if I’d realized I was so close to the end). After waiting a couple of days to play it because LucasArts had to send a replacement for a bad disk (which they did promptly with no fuss, I should add), it was kind of a let down. We replayed it on maximum difficulty to get the somewhat lame special scene only available in hard mode, but I do remember the story being really enchanting and cool. Just… short.</p><p>Not short enough to dissuade me from trying out <strong>The Secret of Monkey Island</strong>. Wow. The first two <strong>Monkey Island</strong> games were… just beyond awesome. Except for the stupid “Monkey Wrench” puzzle in <strong>MI2</strong>. I was very gratified to hear that Tim Schafer has finally admitted that that puzzle was stupid and unfair. I feel vindicated, twenty years later. I didn’t play the later <strong>Monkey Island</strong> games to completion, but in retrospect they were really good games. And the far more recent Tales of Monkey Island series from Telltale Games continue the tradition admirably.</p><p>And there were others. <strong>Sam &amp; Max</strong>, for example, which was bizarre yet cool – which I keep promising myself I’ll finish one day. And <strong>Full Throttle</strong> – another one I’m rather regretful that I missed, which people tell me was an even more spectacular example of the graphic adventure genre than <strong>Day of the Tentacle</strong>.</p><p><a href=\"http://rampantgames.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/GrimFandangoCover.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-5742\" alt=\"GrimFandangoCover\" src=\"http://rampantgames.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/GrimFandangoCover.jpg\" width=\"256\" height=\"341\" align=\"right\" hspace=\"9\" vspace=\"4\" /></a>But the best adventure game of them all – to this day – remains Schafer’s <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grim_Fandango\"><strong>Grim Fandango</strong></a>. I’m not sure I can tell you why – it’s been so long since I played through the whole thing.  I think it was a combination of the delightful weirdness of the setting (an entire world based on the Mexican Day of the Dead festival mixed with film noir? Really?), and the absolutely rock-solid, lovable (and hate-able) characters.</p><p>And one of the most loveable was the main character. While Manuel Calevera was the source of plenty of comedy on his own (spoken with a Mexican Spanish accent),  he was very, very different from other comic main characters like Guybrush Threepwood. He’s a film noir hero with comic timing – assertive, worldly, ambitious. At the end of one chapter, he finds himself stuck in a restaurant, inheriting the janitor’s job while he waits to find the girl, Mercedes (“Meche”).  The scene shifts to the next chapter – one year later – and Manny is now the owner of said establishment, and has turned it into a hot nightclub on the waterfront that might as well have been named “Rick’s Cafe” from the movie Casablanca.</p><p>And then there was Glottis. Glottis the elemental, Glottis the mechanic, Glottis the guy who can turn a hearse into a hot-rod.</p><p>And, sadly, the game was quite nearly the end for LucasArts adventure games. And, at least for me, the end of the time when LucasArts really mattered to me. They had one more lukewarm <strong>Monkey Island</strong> sequel in them, and that was that. At least until they licensed some remakes and the <strong>Tales of Monkey Island</strong>.</p><p>It’s been over a decade since then, and while there have been some really awesome Star Wars licensed games (<strong>LEGO Star Wars</strong>, the <strong>Knights of the Old Republic</strong> RPGs) in the intervening years, LucasArts as a developer and publisher has really been dead for a long time for me.  The people who made it awesome – who made these wonderful games – have since gone off and joined or started other companies. And they continue to do great things and make great games.</p><p>So really, the great studio that was LucasArts isn’t really dead. It’s just moved on. Literally. I feel bad for the approximately 150 employees let go by yesterday’s action, and hope they will rapidly find new employment and do great things in the games industry. Or maybe go indie and wow us with their skills. But yeah – LucasArts has really been pretty dead for a long time. So while I’m sad to see the era officially come to an end, if I were in Disney’s shoes, I’d probably have made the same decision.</p><p><strong>WIN A GAME</strong></p><p>Okay, so instead of doing <strong>Frayed Knights</strong> related trivia today, I just want your post in the comments telling us what your favorite LucasArts game is, and why.  Please use your real email address, which nobody else can see but I can use to contact you. I’ll pick a winner at random from among the commenters.  If for some reason you do not want the game (don’t want to deal with Gamer’s Gate, or you already have the game), add the note (N/G) (for “No Game”) to your comment, but feel free to participate.</p><p>Let’s all lift a glass to the LucasArts of old.

Or maybe go indie and wow us with their skills. But yeah &#8211; LucasArts has really been pretty dead for a long time.

Because this kind of in-depth background is the sort of thing that makes the world of <a href=\"http://frayedknights.com\"><strong>Frayed Knights</strong></a> come alive.  (And as a reminder, check back tomorrow for some <strong>Frayed Knights</strong> – related Stuff Happening).</p><p>Birz Flemmins is a priest of Pokmor Xang. Or, rather, a former priest of Pokmor Xang, as there was only one known temple where the the religion was practiced, and it is no longer in operation after not just one but TWO attacks by greedy adventurers after their secrets and treasures. Flemmins fortunately survived both assaults, and was willing to talk to me about the secret life of a priest of the pus god.</p><p><strong>Rampant Coyote:</strong> So Birz, how did you first come to follow Pokmor Xang, the god of Blisters, Boils, and Pimples?</p><p><strong>Birz Flemmins:</strong> Well, me family – particularly me mum – favored the goddess Karamesis… the goddess of ribbon and bunting. And home decor, I think. Me, I went through the whole rebellion phase, and one day I heard about Pokmor Xang, and started worshiping him. On a lark, you know?</p><p><strong>Rampant Coyote:</strong> So it wasn’t serious?</p><p><strong>Birz Flemmins:</strong> Naw, not at first, no. But it got me parents’ underclothes in a wad, so I was happy enough about that.</p><p><strong>Rampant Coyote:</strong> So how did you go from that to becoming an actual priest of Pokmor Xang?</p><p><strong>Birz Flemmins:</strong> We was in town at the market and I heard a man actually preaching about Pokmor Xang. It caught me fancy, so I listened. That man was Kratic Barg, the founder of the New Pokmor Xang Movement. Wot he said made sense to me.  Plus, he offered free donuts. Mainly the donuts.</p><p><strong>Rampant Coyote:</strong> What did he say?</p><p><strong>Birz Flemmins:</strong> Oh, he went on about bringing Pokmor Xang out of obscurity, and that the god’s gratitude for the restoration of his religion would know no bounds. Since I had me a serious acne condition at the time, I figured I could use all the help I could get. And dark powers of magic sounded pretty fun, too. Plus, me parents were pretty anxious to get me apprenticed out of the house. Partly because they were sick of me burning the appropriate incense to Pokmor Xang on our porch.  And they’d given up hope of me bein’ much good at anything else. So I signed on right then as Barg’s apprentice, and never went home again.</p><p>Barg taught us that wot we needed was a good “Public Relations” campaign for Pokmor Xang. He chucked the old-fashioned boil-ridden demon iconography and stuff like that, and instead used the happy Pokmor Xang wit’ the greasy breakfast image.  He also taught that people would respect and fear us when we displayed true power, and that would make all the difference and make us a major religion. Oh, and the occasional human sacrifice. Barg told us that nobody takes a dark religion seriously unless they hold the occasional human sacrifice.</p><p><strong>Rampant Coyote:</strong> So were you there when he established the temple near Ardin?</p><p><strong>Birz Flemmins:</strong> Oh, yeah. It was actually a former lizard-man temple of some ugly demon decades earlier. I guess some adventurers had raided THAT temple back before I was born, and killed all the lizard men. But Barg said that was perfect, as it still had some of it’s old dark mojo that would aid us in our work.</p><p>Lookin’ back, I guess knowin’ that the previous temple had been raided and all the inhabitants killed should have been a tip-off that it weren’t gonna end well.</p><p><strong>Rampant Coyote:</strong> What was your greatest accomplishment in your time with the temple of Pokmor Xang?</p><p><strong>Birz Flemmins:</strong> I’m pretty proud of the year or so I spent collecting pus to create the pus golems. You have no idea how challenging that was.</p><p><strong>Rampant Coyote:</strong> I’m afraid to ask…</p><p><strong>Birz Flemmins:</strong> You gotta secretly infect a town wit’ contagious boils.  Then you come into town a few days later pretending to be some kind of healer.</p><p><strong>Rampant Coyote:</strong> I think I’m going to be sick.</p><p><strong>Birz Flemmins:</strong> Too late, I’m retired, find yer own damn healer.</p><p><strong> Rampant Coyote:</strong> Uh…. where was I? The masks! What was it with the masks?</p><p><strong>Birz Flemmins:</strong> They’re traditional, I hear. Plus they had an herbal compartment in the nose.</p><p><strong>Rampant Coyote:</strong> Herbal compartment?</p><p><strong>Birz Flemmins:</strong> For strong herbs. You work wit’ rancid pus every day, you need something to block the smell.</p><p><strong>Rampant Coyote:</strong> Uh…. yeah. Okay.</p><p><strong>Birz Flemmins:</strong> Believe me, lookin’ at some o’ my fellow priests – the masks were an improvement.</p><p><strong>Rampant Coyote:</strong> How did you survive the adventurer assault?</p><p><strong>Birz Flemmins:</strong> I was out in another town collectin’ more pus to make golems. Had two barrels of the stuff. Came back to the temple a week after the attack, and the place smelled worse than ever.</p><p><strong>Rampant Coyote:</strong> So what have you been doing since?</p><p><strong>Birz Flemmins:</strong> I been keepin’ busy.  Got a job as a thug, breakin’ arms and legs and stuff. It’s fulfilling. I still use my powers sometimes, too. I earn extra money on weekends entertaining at children’s birthday parties. Also, I heard that there’s a job opening up in an army of evil that’s s’posed to take over the world sometime soon, and they need evil priests. I figure I could apply for that.</p><p><strong>Rampant Coyote:</strong> Any regrets?</p><p><strong>Birz Flemmins:</strong> Only that I ain’t been able to get revenge on the bastards wot raided the temple.  Someday, I figger. Maybe wit’ that evil army.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>" "http://rampantgames.com/blog/?p=5716" (20825 44412) new 6 nil nil ((title nil "Interview with a Priest of Pokmor-Xang") (link nil "http://rampantgames.com/blog/?p=5716") (comments nil "http://rampantgames.com/blog/?p=5716#comments") (pubDate nil "Mon, 01 Apr 2013 15:53:32 +0000") (dc:creator nil "Rampant Coyote") (category nil "Frayed Knights") (category nil "Interviews") (guid ((isPermaLink .

Because this kind of in-depth background is the sort of thing that makes the world of <a href=\"http://frayedknights.com\"><strong>Frayed Knights</strong></a> come alive.  (And as a reminder, check back tomorrow for some <strong>Frayed Knights</strong> &#8211; related Stuff Happening).</p><p>Birz Flemmins is a priest of Pokmor Xang. Or, rather, a former priest of Pokmor Xang, as there was only one known temple where the the religion was practiced, and it is no longer in operation after not just one but TWO attacks by greedy adventurers after their secrets and treasures. Flemmins fortunately survived both assaults, and was willing to talk to me about the secret life of a priest of the pus god.</p><p><strong>Rampant Coyote:</strong> So Birz, how did you first come to follow Pokmor Xang, the god of Blisters, Boils, and Pimples?</p><p><strong>Birz Flemmins:</strong> Well, me family &#8211; particularly me mum &#8211; favored the goddess Karamesis&#8230; the goddess of ribbon and bunting. And home decor, I think. Me, I went through the whole rebellion phase, and one day I heard about Pokmor Xang, and started worshiping him. On a lark, you know?</p><p><strong>Rampant Coyote:</strong> So it wasn&#8217;t serious?</p><p><strong>Birz Flemmins:</strong> Naw, not at first, no. But it got me parents&#8217; underclothes in a wad, so I was happy enough about that.</p><p><strong>Rampant Coyote:</strong> So how did you go from that to becoming an actual priest of Pokmor Xang?</p><p><strong>Birz Flemmins:</strong> We was in town at the market and I heard a man actually preaching about Pokmor Xang. It caught me fancy, so I listened. That man was Kratic Barg, the founder of the New Pokmor Xang Movement. Wot he said made sense to me.  Plus, he offered free donuts. Mainly the donuts.</p><p><strong>Rampant Coyote:</strong> What did he say?</p><p><strong>Birz Flemmins:</strong> Oh, he went on about bringing Pokmor Xang out of obscurity, and that the god&#8217;s gratitude for the restoration of his religion would know no bounds. Since I had me a serious acne condition at the time, I figured I could use all the help I could get. And dark powers of magic sounded pretty fun, too. Plus, me parents were pretty anxious to get me apprenticed out of the house. Partly because they were sick of me burning the appropriate incense to Pokmor Xang on our porch.  And they&#8217;d given up hope of me bein&#8217; much good at anything else. So I signed on right then as Barg&#8217;s apprentice, and never went home again.</p><p>Barg taught us that wot we needed was a good &#8220;Public Relations&#8221; campaign for Pokmor Xang. He chucked the old-fashioned boil-ridden demon iconography and stuff like that, and instead used the happy Pokmor Xang wit&#8217; the greasy breakfast image.  He also taught that people would respect and fear us when we displayed true power, and that would make all the difference and make us a major religion. Oh, and the occasional human sacrifice. Barg told us that nobody takes a dark religion seriously unless they hold the occasional human sacrifice.</p><p><strong>Rampant Coyote:</strong> So were you there when he established the temple near Ardin?</p><p><strong>Birz Flemmins:</strong> Oh, yeah. It was actually a former lizard-man temple of some ugly demon decades earlier. I guess some adventurers had raided THAT temple back before I was born, and killed all the lizard men. But Barg said that was perfect, as it still had some of it&#8217;s old dark mojo that would aid us in our work.</p><p>Lookin&#8217; back, I guess knowin&#8217; that the previous temple had been raided and all the inhabitants killed should have been a tip-off that it weren&#8217;t gonna end well.</p><p><strong>Rampant Coyote:</strong> What was your greatest accomplishment in your time with the temple of Pokmor Xang?</p><p><strong>Birz Flemmins:</strong> I&#8217;m pretty proud of the year or so I spent collecting pus to create the pus golems. You have no idea how challenging that was.</p><p><strong>Rampant Coyote:</strong> I&#8217;m afraid to ask&#8230;</p><p><strong>Birz Flemmins:</strong> You gotta secretly infect a town wit&#8217; contagious boils.  Then you come into town a few days later pretending to be some kind of healer.</p><p><strong>Rampant Coyote:</strong> I think I&#8217;m going to be sick.</p><p><strong>Birz Flemmins:</strong> Too late, I&#8217;m retired, find yer own damn healer.</p><p><strong> Rampant Coyote:</strong> Uh&#8230;. where was I? The masks! What was it with the masks?</p><p><strong>Birz Flemmins:</strong> They&#8217;re traditional, I hear. Plus they had an herbal compartment in the nose.</p><p><strong>Rampant Coyote:</strong> Herbal compartment?</p><p><strong>Birz Flemmins:</strong> For strong herbs. You work wit&#8217; rancid pus every day, you need something to block the smell.</p><p><strong>Rampant Coyote:</strong> Uh&#8230;. yeah. Okay.</p><p><strong>Birz Flemmins:</strong> Believe me, lookin&#8217; at some o&#8217; my fellow priests &#8211; the masks were an improvement.</p><p><strong>Rampant Coyote:</strong> How did you survive the adventurer assault?</p><p><strong>Birz Flemmins:</strong> I was out in another town collectin&#8217; more pus to make golems. Had two barrels of the stuff. Came back to the temple a week after the attack, and the place smelled worse than ever.</p><p><strong>Rampant Coyote:</strong> So what have you been doing since?</p><p><strong>Birz Flemmins:</strong> I been keepin&#8217; busy.  Got a job as a thug, breakin&#8217; arms and legs and stuff. It&#8217;s fulfilling. I still use my powers sometimes, too. I earn extra money on weekends entertaining at children&#8217;s birthday parties. Also, I heard that there&#8217;s a job opening up in an army of evil that&#8217;s s&#8217;posed to take over the world sometime soon, and they need evil priests. I figure I could apply for that.</p><p><strong>Rampant Coyote:</strong> Any regrets?</p><p><strong>Birz Flemmins:</strong> Only that I ain&#8217;t been able to get revenge on the bastards wot raided the temple.  Someday, I figger. Maybe wit&#8217; that evil army.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

I think I succeeded. Here are some of my favorites:</p><p>“Baba Yaga’s Unbelievable Armor Intensification”<br />
“Primordial Magic Defense Impairment of Ariel”<br />
“Underwhelming Revival”<br />
“Fangal’s Cryptic Magic Defense Bonus”<br />
“Arkan’s Introductory Magic Defense Failure”<br />
“Sufficient Vim”<br />
“Cleansing of Apuleius”<br />
“Penelope’s Occult Boon”<br />
“Oakfather’s Empowerment”<br />
“Wimpy Spellwipe”<br />
“Wussy Crawl”<br />
“Worthy Armor Restriction”<br />
“Brutus’s Explosive Core Punishment”<br />
“Zalem’s Unfathomable Spiky Devastation”</p><p>I’ll tell ya – I want to use <em>Zalem’s Unfathomable Spiky Devastation</em> just based on the name. (For the record, it’s a Sorcerer spell that does piercing damage to a single target). Sadly, the random tables are pretty large, so the chances I’ll ever see that spell again are almost non-existent. To be honest, I learned quite a few new words as I was putting together the tables. I’d never even heard the word, “caliginous” before (and it still fails my spell-checker).  Pretty cool stuff, really. I learned a lot of new words reading Gary Gygax’s text back when I was a kid, too.</p><p>Although if I decide to localize for other languages, I’ve got some serious challenges in hand.</p><p>Of course, amusing-but-plausible spell names are only a tiny part of the equation. Most of the magic of the magic system, so to speak, comes from the formulas that make it work, and how they work with the rest of the system. Now, as far as balancing is concerned, we won’t know “for sure” until we’re deep into testing. But since it’s all based on what worked and was (reasonably) balanced in FK1, I think we’re going to at least start out in the same ballpark.</p><p>Since the action system has been completely redone from the ground up, there are a few things that may need addressing. For example, in FK1, all “Mass” spells (which affected an entire group) required the use of a spellstone. They were just too powerful without that limiting factor, even with a high endurance cost.  Now, although they currently still have a spellstone cost, mass / group spells also require a higher action tier, which slows down their use. Will that be enough to balance them all by itself? I’m not sure.</p><p>In FK1, I had never-exercised code that also handled ‘rank’ area effects – a spell that could effect all enemies within a single rank (distance). All two of them, max, as it turns out.  But as the list of spells started getting out of control, I realized there was just not enough room for it, so no spells took advantage of it.  But now it’s entirely possible to generate all kinds of potential spells, and let players mix and match their “optimum loadout” for whatever situations they can expect.  In addition to “rank” based area effect, there are more: “Penetrating” area effects that actually affect creatures behind your target.  Then there’s “explosive,” which might be the most challenging one to balance. It’s sort of a lower-strength “Mass” spell effect:  The primary target gets hit with the full effect, and all other members of the target’s group get hit with reduced versions of the effects. Then there are “self-only” spells. These spells can’t be targeted and only affect the caster… but they are more powerful than normal.</p><p>A spell can have up to three effects of various kinds. Effects are broken into offensive and defensive types, and all effects must be of the same type. So you can’t have a spell that simultaneously damages opponents and increases your party’s speed. So far, that seems to be a restriction that is workable.</p><p>I’ve also gotten rid of some damage types.  Disease, sonic, water-based, and a few other lesser- or never-used (in FK1) damage types have gone away. Disease is now represented by status conditions.  That still leaves plenty of damage types – edged, piercing, priestly, fire, frost, shocking, poison, etc.</p><p>I’ve also limited spell enhancements to only three levels, instead of five as in the first game. I figure, with all these gazillions of potential spells out there, there’s no need to press one into higher-level service for a long time. And with that in mind, I also changed the rules somewhat about what the spell enhancements really do.  I figure that if you are gonna dump spellstones into enhancing a spell’s power, it should be really over-the-top.  Previously, in FK1, if the enhancement took the spell over your normal “spellcasting level”, you could not cast it with that enhancement. In FK2, that restriction has been lifted…  In fact, the primary use of spell enhancements is to “overcharge” a spell to something normally beyond your power to apply.  In addition to increasing the spell’s effective power level, enhancements also increase the ‘magical attack’ rating – making them less likely to miss.  So enhancements are really there when you absolutely, postively have to kill it this round!</p><p>As I previously discussed – the dynamically generated spells are mixed in with standard and “common” spells. Common spells are always there, automatically in the spellbook for casters of a certain level and proficiency (and the right feats).  These are bread-and-butter spells of a particular casting field. Fireballs for wizards, heals for divine clerics.  Then there are also “Standard” spells, spells which are not automatically available, but are still “fixed” and guaranteed to be available somewhere in the game.  Many of these will have unique special effects, and will often be “overpowered” compared to the common and dynamically generated spells. This is where things like “<em>Power Word: Defenestrate</em>” live.</p><p>It’s certainly different.  But as the system has taken form, I’m growing more confident this will all work.</p>" "http://rampantgames.com/blog/?p=5685" (20820 22421) new 10 nil nil ((title nil "Frayed Knights 2: How do you spell that spell?")

&#8220;Zalem&#8217;s Unfathomable Spiky Devastation&#8221;</p><p>I&#8217;ll tell ya &#8211; I want to use <em>Zalem&#8217;s Unfathomable Spiky Devastation</em> just based on the name. (For the record, it&#8217;s a Sorcerer spell that does piercing damage to a single target). Sadly, the random tables are pretty large, so the chances I&#8217;ll ever see that spell again are almost non-existent. To be honest, I learned quite a few new words as I was putting together the tables. I&#8217;d never even heard the word, &#8220;caliginous&#8221; before (and it still fails my spell-checker).  Pretty cool stuff, really. I learned a lot of new words reading Gary Gygax&#8217;s text back when I was a kid, too.</p><p>Although if I decide to localize for other languages, I&#8217;ve got some serious challenges in hand.</p><p>Of course, amusing-but-plausible spell names are only a tiny part of the equation. Most of the magic of the magic system, so to speak, comes from the formulas that make it work, and how they work with the rest of the system. Now, as far as balancing is concerned, we won&#8217;t know &#8220;for sure&#8221; until we&#8217;re deep into testing. But since it&#8217;s all based on what worked and was (reasonably) balanced in FK1, I think we&#8217;re going to at least start out in the same ballpark.</p><p>Since the action system has been completely redone from the ground up, there are a few things that may need addressing. For example, in FK1, all &#8220;Mass&#8221; spells (which affected an entire group) required the use of a spellstone. They were just too powerful without that limiting factor, even with a high endurance cost.  Now, although they currently still have a spellstone cost, mass / group spells also require a higher action tier, which slows down their use. Will that be enough to balance them all by itself? I&#8217;m not sure.</p><p>In FK1, I had never-exercised code that also handled &#8216;rank&#8217; area effects &#8211; a spell that could effect all enemies within a single rank (distance). All two of them, max, as it turns out.  But as the list of spells started getting out of control, I realized there was just not enough room for it, so no spells took advantage of it.  But now it&#8217;s entirely possible to generate all kinds of potential spells, and let players mix and match their &#8220;optimum loadout&#8221; for whatever situations they can expect.  In addition to &#8220;rank&#8221; based area effect, there are more: &#8220;Penetrating&#8221; area effects that actually affect creatures behind your target.  Then there&#8217;s &#8220;explosive,&#8221; which might be the most challenging one to balance. It&#8217;s sort of a lower-strength &#8220;Mass&#8221; spell effect:  The primary target gets hit with the full effect, and all other members of the target&#8217;s group get hit with reduced versions of the effects. Then there are &#8220;self-only&#8221; spells. These spells can&#8217;t be targeted and only affect the caster&#8230; but they are more powerful than normal.</p><p>A spell can have up to three effects of various kinds. Effects are broken into offensive and defensive types, and all effects must be of the same type. So you can&#8217;t have a spell that simultaneously damages opponents and increases your party&#8217;s speed. So far, that seems to be a restriction that is workable.</p><p>I&#8217;ve also gotten rid of some damage types.  Disease, sonic, water-based, and a few other lesser- or never-used (in FK1) damage types have gone away. Disease is now represented by status conditions.  That still leaves plenty of damage types &#8211; edged, piercing, priestly, fire, frost, shocking, poison, etc.</p><p>I&#8217;ve also limited spell enhancements to only three levels, instead of five as in the first game. I figure, with all these gazillions of potential spells out there, there&#8217;s no need to press one into higher-level service for a long time. And with that in mind, I also changed the rules somewhat about what the spell enhancements really do.  I figure that if you are gonna dump spellstones into enhancing a spell&#8217;s power, it should be really over-the-top.  Previously, in FK1, if the enhancement took the spell over your normal &#8220;spellcasting level&#8221;, you could not cast it with that enhancement. In FK2, that restriction has been lifted&#8230;  In fact, the primary use of spell enhancements is to &#8220;overcharge&#8221; a spell to something normally beyond your power to apply.  In addition to increasing the spell&#8217;s effective power level, enhancements also increase the &#8216;magical attack&#8217; rating &#8211; making them less likely to miss.  So enhancements are really there when you absolutely, postively have to kill it this round!</p><p>As I previously discussed &#8211; the dynamically generated spells are mixed in with standard and &#8220;common&#8221; spells. Common spells are always there, automatically in the spellbook for casters of a certain level and proficiency (and the right feats).  These are bread-and-butter spells of a particular casting field. Fireballs for wizards, heals for divine clerics.  Then there are also &#8220;Standard&#8221; spells, spells which are not automatically available, but are still &#8220;fixed&#8221; and guaranteed to be available somewhere in the game.  Many of these will have unique special effects, and will often be &#8220;overpowered&#8221; compared to the common and dynamically generated spells. This is where things like &#8220;<em>Power Word: Defenestrate</em>&#8221; live.</p><p>It&#8217;s certainly different.  But as the system has taken form, I&#8217;m growing more confident this will all work.</p>

A nice blend of cycles keeps the game varied and interesting. You’ve got the combat cycles – nice, repeating elements that (hopefully!) stay varied enough between different enemies and growing player character power and varying resources that it’s never a complete repetition. And of course, the character growth and loot cycles.  And bits of exposition (not really a cycle) to keep the context changing.</p><p><a href=\"http://rampantgames.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/trekenterprise.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-5680\" alt=\"trekenterprise\" src=\"http://rampantgames.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/trekenterprise-300x168.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"168\" align=\"right\" hspace=\"9\" vspace=\"4\" /></a>For me, exploration is a major element of CRPGs. The whole Star Trek opening monologue captures the spirit of adventure for me. Sure, there may be swashbuckling or grim battles to fight and fantastic loot to be acquired, and of course expertise to be gained – but those are all secondary, or at least co-equal, to the feeling of exploration for me. Even if the entire game takes place within the well-trodden streets of a city, where I’m boldly going where many-a-person has gone before, I want find secrets, surprises, and wonder around every corner. Maybe that’s a projection of my optimism for the real world into games, but that’s how I am.</p><p>Of course, those efforts must be rewarded. If you play a (well-designed) RPG in the style of 16-bit JRPGs, you’ll often find that almost every extended “dead-end” path terminates with a chest with a treasure in it. It may not make much sense from a realism perspective, but as a game mechanic, it rewards thorough exploration. This also extends the game (from a development perspective), as this kind of “content” is pretty easy to generate, and causes the player not only to consume this “cheap” content. It also slows the play down as the player actively hunts for these kinds of rewards, making the game longer. Overdo it, and it becomes boring “filler.” But done right, it’s fun stuff that rewards careful, exploration-based gameplay.</p><p>But there should be a lot more than that. More to do than just wander down side paths, and more to the rewards than just chests with a bonus potion.</p><p>The trick in CRPGs is that this kind of content gets EXPENSIVE. That’s a big part of the reason this genre of game is known to be a budget-breaker. And no, before you say it, purely dynamic content is not the answer. Maybe part of the answer (it certainly makes for interesting rewards, as Diablo-style games easily attest), but certainly not the whole answer. ‘Cuz basically, once you’ve gotten a feel for the formulas at work, exploring dynamically generated environments has only slightly more excitement than hunting down prime numbers in math.</p><p><a href=\"http://rampantgames.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/searching.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-5679\" alt=\"searching\" src=\"http://rampantgames.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/searching-214x300.jpg\" width=\"214\" height=\"300\" align=\"left\" hspace=\"9\" vspace=\"4\" /></a>I just thought I’d break down a bunch of ideas – most of which have appeared in some CRPGs in the past (especially if you include <a href=\"http://frayedknights.com\">Frayed Knights </a>- I experimented with a few of ideas for that) – for both the different ways you can explore content – adding extra dimensions to the exploration gameplay cycle, and for the kinds of rewards that can be obtained for doing so.</p><p>Adding depth to the exploration mechanic can be a little perilous. It’s not hard for things to get bogged down this way, particularly if it involves returning to previously-explored areas (backtracking) in a large game-world with slow navigation, or if the system is too plodding and methodical. (Yeah, I know, I’m working on improving that with FK2 searches). These should be recurring mechanics in the game – not only does that economize on content &amp; code creation (you don’t want to spend so much time on a one-off effect, do you?), but it also then provides a “skill” for the player (not the character) to learn and master – recognizing and acting on these opportunities. Here are a handful of ideas:</p><p>Here are some ideas for layers / depth / interaction to the exploration mechanic, or in many cases to create obstacles or puzzles to free navigation. Some are pretty common, others – not so much:</p><p>#1 – Movement – you go somewhere and something happens.</p><p>#2 – Interaction – you must click on something to explore what it does / says</p><p>#3 – Hidden interaction. Like #2 but it’s not obvious – like a secret door, or a sword tucked away in the corner. Care must be taken to make sure these aren’t TOO hidden, or the game becomes a “hunt the pixel” exercise.</p><p>#4 – Use a skill or ability or a tool (item) in a particular spot to reveal a secret – for example, Mario ducking on pipes to discover the ones with “secrets” in Super Mario Brothers</p><p>#5 – Using a skill or ability or a tool (item) in a particular spot to reach an otherwise unattainable location.</p><p>#6 – Illusionary obstacles – like an illusionary wall or a hidden bridge across a chasm.</p><p>#7 – Destroyable obstacles. Particularly ones that can’t be destroyed by chopping at it with a hand weapon.</p><p>#8 – Sequences of actions done in a particular spot – these are usually either explained to the player or strongly hinted at.</p><p>#9 – Luring a computer-controlled entity (example: NPC, enemy, or a trap effect) to unlock the environment in a way the player cannot by himself.</p><p>#10 – The world / information / rewards change with time – perhaps as the game progresses, with the seasons, or just time of day. Silent villagers during the day are talkative at night, moongates shift position and destination based on phases of the moon, etc.  Or as a really weird idea, what if the player could experience “flashbacks” in various locations to what happened at an earlier time as they learn more about the world?</p><p>#11 – New ability reveals all-new information / objects / alternate versions of the world. Maybe a dog added to the party can “see” smells that were previously invisible, or the player character can “phase shift” into a shadowy unpopulated alternate dimension version of the same world.</p><p>#12 – Proximity Clues – the player is not given the exact location of what they are looking for, but may explore with hints revealing either the approximate location (maybe an area to be searched), or as in <strong>Frayed Knights</strong>, updates as to whether you are getting “warmer” or “colder” as you search.</p><p>#13 – Need special equipment or vehicle to pass – perhaps scuba gear to explore an underwater area, or a magic carpet to fly over an impassible mountain range. This differs from #5 in that it’s not a specific action done in a particular location, but rather the possession (or equipping) of the item allows access to all terrain of of this kind.</p><p>#14 – A physical or mental puzzle is required to explore deeper. <strong>Dungeon Master</strong> style games – like the recent <strong>Legend of Grimrock</strong> – are full of these.</p><p>#15 -Counters. While it’s very “gamey,” having a running counter of the number of undiscovered secrets (possibly broken down by type) can help motivate players and also let them know when to quit digging around every nook and cranny.  Ideally, these would be explained through some kind of mechanic that makes sense within the context of the world, but even a totally external mechanic is often better than nothing, depending upon the style of game.</p><p>#16 – Mood / Reputation / Faction / Alignment / Progress shifts  – the world (or at least the willingness of people to talk about it and give you access to areas and information) changes based on cumulative shifts instigated by the player. Perhaps as you gain the trust of certain villagers, they become more forthcoming with key bits of information. Or efforts to repair flooding throughout the city and direct the flow of water unblocks or reveals new paths.</p><p>Okay, there’s a dozen (Update: I went back and exceeded my dozen. Feature creep!)  ideas for making exploring an environment more interesting. Not all are great, and that’s really just scratching the surface. Hopefully, for RPG designers out there (especially the aspiring / beginning ones), those will at least start you thinking. Now here are a dozen ideas for rewards:</p><p><a href=\"http://rampantgames.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Adventure_Easteregg.png\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-5681\" alt=\"Adventure_Easteregg\" src=\"http://rampantgames.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Adventure_Easteregg-300x187.png\" width=\"300\" height=\"187\" /></a>#1 – Exploration is its own reward. Sometimes – and this is very occasionally, and really depends on the game – just seeing something cool is good enough. Like an “easter egg.”</p><p>#2 – Loot. Yeah. This is done a lot. As this is frequently optional, this is usually one of the more expendable / cumulative resources rather than a major permanent item.</p><p>#3 – Story Rewards. Doling out a little extra optional exposition might not thrill all players, but the RPG players tend to be the kind that enjoy this kind of thing.</p><p>#4 – Clues / Hints to more locations to explore or ways to circumvent their challenges. Yes, this reward for exploration encourages… MORE exploration.</p><p>#5 – New environments. The classic Super Mario Brothers “Secret World” reward. These are obviously expensive for developers to make, but the promise of a few of these scattered throughout the world can make exploration REALLY exciting.</p><p>#6 – A bonus quest</p><p>#7 – A potential new NPC companion</p><p>#8 – An experience point award. Minor, but cool.</p><p>#9 – A challenging optional puzzle or combat encounter (with its own reward).</p><p>#10 – A location that can recharge player resources – like a fountain that restores health or magic points, or a merchant.</p><p>#11 – A hint, strategy, or action that can be taken to make an upcoming “boss” encounter easier.  This is, IMO, a far more exciting way of rewarding careful players than simply making their brute-force abilities more potent (with more potions, XP for the treadmill, etc.). I did this a few times in <a href=\"http://frayedknights.com\"><strong>Frayed Knights: The Skull of S’makh – Daon</strong></a>… you could bypass the a big chunk of the dungeon and go straight to the boss, or you could explore and deprive the boss of power or reinforcements.</p><p>#12 – A piece of a bigger reward or puzzle gets exposed.</p><p>#13 – Reputation / Vanity award – because of what you have explored or done,  other characters react to you differently based on the news. This can either be a one-time specific reward, or add towards a cumulative “reputation” score.</p><p>#14 – Customization options – this provides no actual gameplay reward, but gives the player the addition of new visuals, sounds, or whatnot to make their character unique.</p><p>#15 – Cumulative Story Progression – maybe you need to achieve a certain number or percentage of exploration-based goals to progress a story or quest. Beware – done poorly, this can lead to a boring “Kill ten rats” type of goal.</p><p>#16 – Unlocking of certain other obstacles. A tried and true variation.</p><p>Again, there are probably an infinite number of permutations, alternatives, and combinations of these ideas that can help make a more interesting RPG that relies upon more than simply beating the snot out of bad guys.</p>" "http://rampantgames.com/blog/?p=5678" (20819 17207) new 11 nil nil ((title nil "Deep Exploration: 32 Ideas for making exploration more interesting in CRPGs") (link nil "http://rampantgames.com/blog/?p=5678") (comments nil "http://rampantgames.com/blog/?p=5678#comments") (pubDate nil "Wed, 27 Mar 2013 19:06:31 +0000") (dc:creator nil "Rampant Coyote") (category nil "Design") (guid ((isPermaLink .

I did this a few times in <a href=\"http://frayedknights.com\"><strong>Frayed Knights: The Skull of S&#8217;makh &#8211; Daon</strong></a>&#8230; you could bypass the a big chunk of the dungeon and go straight to the boss, or you could explore and deprive the boss of power or reinforcements.</p><p>#12 &#8211; A piece of a bigger reward or puzzle gets exposed.</p><p>#13 &#8211; Reputation / Vanity award &#8211; because of what you have explored or done,  other characters react to you differently based on the news. This can either be a one-time specific reward, or add towards a cumulative &#8220;reputation&#8221; score.</p><p>#14 &#8211; Customization options &#8211; this provides no actual gameplay reward, but gives the player the addition of new visuals, sounds, or whatnot to make their character unique.</p><p>#15 &#8211; Cumulative Story Progression &#8211; maybe you need to achieve a certain number or percentage of exploration-based goals to progress a story or quest. Beware &#8211; done poorly, this can lead to a boring &#8220;Kill ten rats&#8221; type of goal.</p><p>#16 &#8211; Unlocking of certain other obstacles. A tried and true variation.</p><p>Again, there are probably an infinite number of permutations, alternatives, and combinations of these ideas that can help make a more interesting RPG that relies upon more than simply beating the snot out of bad guys.</p>

And gamers – well, they didn’t actually have much of a voice, other than letters to the editor and to the publishers, or by becoming game developers themselves (but who in their right mind would do that?!?!). It was too much work to be a troll. And I think there was more of a recognition of the limitations of games and game developers. And really, games and the underlying technology were so primitive that I think gamers knew there were limitations to their expectations.

I’m really glad that Rock Paper Shotgun and The Escapist have done well, because those sites tend to model what I’d like to see in gaming journalism better, and it seems like much of the industry has taken notice and has started to follow suit.

The Internet gives you a bigger voice than ever, so use it to provide as much positive and constructive feedback as possible, and do your best to police the trolls (and, for that matter, the useless fanboys) as possible. Shame the hyperbole, praise the efforts to keep things down to earth and constructive. And try to remember to comment when you are pleased with things as much as when you are pissed off about something, because most of the time the people who are motivated to write are the ones who are angry about something.

The quote that caused the fuss was, <em>“But other than a few exceptions, like Chris Roberts, I’ve met virtually no one in our industry who I think is close to as good a game designer as I am. I’m not saying that because I think I’m so brilliant. What I’m saying is, I think most game designers really just suck, and I think there’s a reason why.”</em></p><p>The reason, he went on to explain, was that game designers typically have no other skills. The ones with artistic skills become artists. The ones with programming skills become programmers. The ones who can’t do anything else but still want to make games become testers and /or designers. To exaggerate things a little further, he added “<em>And every designer that I work with—all throughout life—I think, frankly, is lazy</em>.”</p><p>Now, tempering his comments, he was explaining how everyone he hired <em>except</em> designers was better than he was. Artists, composers, even (now) programmers.  And you know, I can see that. It’s also something that can be pretty subjective to measure.

A lot of these guys and girls aren’t necessarily the best game designers in the world. They may not even be better than the programmer or artist the next cubicle over.

The quote that caused the fuss was, <em>“But other than a few exceptions, like Chris Roberts, I’ve met virtually no one in our industry who I think is close to as good a game designer as I am. I’m not saying that because I think I’m so brilliant. What I’m saying is, I think most game designers really just suck, and I think there’s a reason why.”</em></p><p>The reason, he went on to explain, was that game designers typically have no other skills. The ones with artistic skills become artists. The ones with programming skills become programmers. The ones who can&#8217;t do anything else but still want to make games become testers and /or designers. To exaggerate things a little further, he added “<em>And every designer that I work with—all throughout life—I think, frankly, is lazy</em>.”</p><p>Now, tempering his comments, he was explaining how everyone he hired <em>except</em> designers was better than he was.

The press. He’s been doing this for about twelve years, at several different websites and now as editor-in-chief of True PC Gaming for the last two, and while he couldn’t speak for all game journalists and gaming website / magazine editors, he had twenty-five minutes of pretty dense, valuable information for both new and veteran indies.</p><p>I took copious notes, but I am not sure if he’s going to be offering the presentation himself online or not, so I’ll just summarize. Here were a few of his major points:</p><p>#1 – Be professional in your communications. This means make it concise, use proper grammar and spelling, and treat it as a professional business. If you don’t take it seriously, and write like you are just some kid making games in his parents’ basement, they won’t take you seriously. He says he honestly tries to read every email that he’s sent, but he gets a TON of email, and a ton of press releases, and if one is just too painful to read… he might not.</p><p>#2 – Be enthusiastic. This is marketing. You need to market to whomever is reading your press release, which means you need to get them emotionally invested and ready to commit to action in that one or two minutes you have their attention. This means you need to be confident and enthusiastic about the product, tell a good story, include screenshots (you’d be surprised by the number of indies who fail to do this!), include a link to a demo AND, if possible, a link to a review copy IN THE EMAIL. If they need to send another email to you and lose a day in communication waiting for a response for more info, things may get forgotten.</p><p>#3 – Don’t be intimidated. It doesn’t matter how big they are, or how many hits their websites get, or how famous they are in the gaming circles – nor does it matter how insignificant you, the indie developer, are. After all, you actually make games… all they can do is talk about other people’s games. That’s really cool. But we all put our pants on one leg at a time (except for those of us who wear kilts or skirts, I guess…). Be respectful, and expect the same treatment.</p><p>#4 – Be confident and persistent. Nobody can prevent you from being a success but yourself. People will mock you, people will tell you that you can’t do it, and that’s just the nature of the business and the Internet. But ultimately, tell yourself – why CAN’T you make the next <strong>Minecraft</strong>? Why can’t the next big indie success story be yours? Keep at it, and don’t listen to the naysayers. Failures may happen, but they are never permanent unless you quit.</p><p>Okay, after that, we broke off to play games. Well, in theory.</p><p>I did see the recently-released (on iPhone, which I don’t have) <a href=\"http://logicdrillgames.com/games/bullet-train-hell/\"><strong>Bullet Train Hell</strong></a>. What’s funny is I thought this game was release-worthy months ago. I’m kinda surprised it’s only now been released. But seriously – it’s polished and awesome. If you have an iPhone, pick this one up. It’ll be out for the Ouya soon, and I am snagging it as a day one purchase. And I’m not even much of a puzzle-platform game kinda guy. But besides it being a local indie’s game, it’s really fun, clever, cool, polished, and challenging.</p><p><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/sQDGWEnni4g\" height=\"360\" width=\"640\" allowfullscreen=\" \" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p><p>Another really awesome-looking game was not a video game at all – but a collectable-card-game merged with a tactical war game.

But after some success at a local board game convention, they’ve been convinced to make it a physical product as well.</p><p>This is cool. I hope it succeeds.</p><p>By request, I also showed <strong>Frayed Knights: The Skull of S’makh-Daon</strong> at the tail end of the night.</p><p>I missed most of the other games. I will call my excuse “networking.” Yeah. That’s my story and I’m sticking to it. I talked with a lot of people.
