NSHC Red Alert Team has published a detailed analysis of the malware <a href=\"http://training.nshc.net/KOR/Document/virus/20130321_320CyberTerrorIncidentResponseReportbyRedAlert%28EN%29.pdf\">here</a>. There were several hashes mentioned for the same component, which suggest multiple operations under the same campaign.<br /><br />So how did the affected companies get infected? No one knows for sure. However we came across the following <a href=\"https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/e8745c275fefc55d1217139bb770dccbdc604423d6ccf614beda5ac2eb55f2e2/analysis/\">archive</a>:<br /><br /><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/sk_wiper_rar.png\" alt=\"Archive\" height=\"310\" width=\"515\" /><br /><br />The filename of the archive roughly translate to \"The customer's account history\". As a side note, Shinhan bank was one of the affected companies according to reports.<br /><br />Those with keen eye would notice that the malware inside the archive is using double extensions combined with a very long filename to hide the real extension. This is a common social engineering tactic that started during the era of <a href=\"http://www.f-secure.com/v-descs/netsky_q.shtml\">mass mailing worms</a> almost a decade ago. Therefore we believe the archive is most likely sent as attachment in spear phishing e-mails.<br /><br />The malware has a datestamp of March 17, 2013, which is just few days before the incidents. It uses the icon of Internet Explorer and opens the following decoy upon execution:<br /><br /><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/sk_wiper_decoy.png\" alt=\"HTML decoy document\" height=\"666\" width=\"768\" /><br /><br />In the background, the malware downloads and executes the following:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hxxp://www.6885.com/uploads/fb9c6013f1b269b74c8cd139471b96fc/feng.jpg<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saved as %systemdirectory%\\hzcompl.dll<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hxxp://www.clickflower.net/board/images/start_car.gif<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saved as %systemdirectory%\\%random%.dll<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hxxp://mailimg.nate.com/mail/img/button/btn_mycomputer.gif<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saved as %systemdirectory%\\sotd.dll<br /><br />Several other HTTP requests are also made, possibly to download other dependencies of the payloads or simply to obscure the malicious requests from admins monitoring the network traffic.<br /><br />The URLS are either already down or cleaned during our analysis. However the filenames still gave us some clue on the styles of the attacker. For example the file extensions suggest that the payload may be a DLL file. Also \"btn_mycomputer.gif\" suggest that the payload may disguise as an image of a button in a URL. Since we are investigating for possible links to the wiper payloads, we started looking at existing samples.<br /><br />Although we were not able to find exact matches, there were a couple variants of the wiper component that matches the style. The first uses a similarly themed filename called \"<a href=\"https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/510f83af3c41f9892040a8a80b4f3a4736eebee2ec4a7d4bfee63dbe44d7ecff/analysis/\">mb_join.gif</a>\" which may be trying to disguise as an image of a join button on some mobile banking website. The other is a time triggered <a href=\"https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/265fce88baeb29cd9b962b75840eefa2ce75e2662998b1f7c4abacb71b92be7b/analysis/\">DLL sample</a>:<br /><br /><img border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/sk_wiper_time.png\" alt=\"Time trigger\" height=\"334\" width=\"564\" /><br /><br />The code above is equivalent to \"(month * 100 + day) * 100 + hour >= 32,015\" which will only be satisfied during March 20 15:00 and later.<br /><br />Besides spear phishing e-mails, not all affected systems need to get infected themselves. Some variants also wipe remote systems using credentials found in configuration files of certain SSH clients installed in infected systems. Therefore an affected system can simply have one of its user, who uses a vulnerable SSH client, infected for it to get toasted!<br /><br />It is interesting to note that Felix Deimel and VanDyke SSH clients as well as the RAR archive were used in the attacks. These are either third party applications or not supported by Windows natively. Not to mention the attacks specifically wipe remote Linux and Unix based systems. All these specifics give the impression of a targeted attack. 			 <p>On 25/03/13 At 09:43 AM</p>") (guid ((isPermaLink .

Online crime is always international because the Internet has no borders.<br /><br />Today computer viruses and other malicious software are no longer written by hobbyist hackers seeking fame and glory among their peers, but by professional criminals who are making millions with their attacks. These criminals want access to your computer, your PayPal passwords, and your credit card numbers.<br /><br />I spend a big part of my life on the road, and I've visited many of the locations that are considered to be hotspots of online criminal activity. I've met the underground and I've met the cops. And I've learned that things are never as simple as they seem from the surface. One would think that the epicenter for banking attacks, for example, would prioritize fighting them, right?<br /><br />Right, but dig deeper and complications emerge. A good example is a discussion I had with a cybercrime investigator in Brazil. We spoke about the problems in Brazil and how Sao Paolo has become one of the largest source of banking Trojans in the world.<br /><br />The investigator looked at me and said, \"Yes. I understand that. But what you need to understand is that Sao Paolo is also one of the murder capitals of the world. People are regularly gunned down on the streets. So where exactly should we put our resources? To fight cybercrime? Or to fight crimes where people die?\"<br /><br />It's all a matter of balancing. When you balance the damage done by cybercrime and compare it to a loss of life, it's pretty obvious what's more important.<br /><br />National police forces and legal systems are finding it extremely difficult to keep up with the rapid growth of online crime. They have limited resources and expertise to investigate online criminal activity. The victims, police, prosecutors, and judges rarely uncover the full scope of the crimes that often take place across international boundaries. Action against the criminals is too slow, the arrests are few and far between, and too often the penalties are very light, especially compared with those attached to real-world crimes.<br /><br />Because of the low prioritization for prosecuting cybercriminals and the delays in launching effective cybercrime penalties, we are thereby sending the wrong message to the criminals and that's why online crime is growing so fast. Right now would-be online criminals can see that the likelihood of their getting caught and punished is vanishingly small, yet the profits are great.<br /><br />The reality for those in positions such as the Sao Paolo investigator is that they must balance both fiscal constraints and resource limitations. They simply cannot, organizationally, respond to every type of threat. If we are to keep up with the cybercriminals, the key is cooperation. The good news is that the computer security industry is quite unique in the way direct competitors help each other. It's not publicly known, but security companies help each other out all the time.<br /><br />On the surface, computer security vendors are direct competitors. And in fact, the competition is fierce on the sales and marketing side. But on the technical side, we're actually very friendly to each other. It seems that everyone knows everyone else. After all, there are only a few hundred top-level antivirus analysts in the whole world.<br /><br />These analysts meet in face-to-face private meetings, closed workshops, and at security conferences. We run encrypted and closed mailing lists. We chat in secure online systems. And in these venues we exchange information on what's happening.<br /><br />On the surface, this doesn't seem to make sense. Why do we cooperate with our competitors to such a large extent? I believe it's because we have a common enemy.<br /><br />You see, normal software companies do not have enemies, just competitors. In our business, it's different. Obviously we have competitors, but they are not our main problem. Our main problem is the virus writers, the bot authors, the spammers, and the phishers. They hate us. They often attack us directly. And it's our job to try to keep them at bay and do what we can to protect our customers from them.<br /><br />In this job, all the vendors are in the same boat. This is why we help each other.<br /><br />And we need all the help we can get to keep up with the changing landscape of online attacks.<br /><br />All this is happening right now, during our generation. We were the first generation that got online. We should do what we can to secure the net so that it will be there for future generations to enjoy.<br /><br />Mikko Hypponen<br /><br />This text was originally published as foreword in Christopher Elisan's book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/0071792066\">Malware, Rootkits &amp; Botnets, A Beginner's Guide</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><hr> 			 <p>On 22/03/13 At 01:54 PM</p>") (guid ((isPermaLink .

NSHC Red Alert Team has published a detailed analysis of the malware <a href=\"http://training.nshc.net/KOR/Document/virus/20130321_320CyberTerrorIncidentResponseReportbyRedAlert%28EN%29.pdf\">here</a>. There were several hashes mentioned for the same component, which suggest multiple operations under the same campaign.<br /><br />So how did the affected companies get infected? No one knows for sure. However we came across the following <a href=\"https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/e8745c275fefc55d1217139bb770dccbdc604423d6ccf614beda5ac2eb55f2e2/analysis/\">archive</a>:<br /><br /><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/sk_wiper_rar.png\" alt=\"Archive\" height=\"310\" width=\"515\" /><br /><br />The filename of the archive roughly translate to \"The customer's account history\". As a side note, Shinhan bank was one of the affected companies according to reports.<br /><br />Those with keen eye would notice that the malware inside the archive is using double extensions combined with a very long filename to hide the real extension. This is a common social engineering tactic that started during the era of <a href=\"http://www.f-secure.com/v-descs/netsky_q.shtml\">mass mailing worms</a> almost a decade ago. Therefore we believe the archive is most likely sent as attachment in spear phishing e-mails.<br /><br />The malware has a datestamp of March 17, 2013, which is just few days before the incidents. It uses the icon of Internet Explorer and opens the following decoy upon execution:<br /><br /><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/sk_wiper_decoy.png\" alt=\"HTML decoy document\" height=\"666\" width=\"768\" /><br /><br />In the background, the malware downloads and executes the following:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hxxp://www.6885.com/uploads/fb9c6013f1b269b74c8cd139471b96fc/feng.jpg<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saved as %systemdirectory%\\hzcompl.dll<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hxxp://www.clickflower.net/board/images/start_car.gif<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saved as %systemdirectory%\\%random%.dll<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hxxp://mailimg.nate.com/mail/img/button/btn_mycomputer.gif<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saved as %systemdirectory%\\sotd.dll<br /><br />Several other HTTP requests are also made, possibly to download other dependencies of the payloads or simply to obscure the malicious requests from admins monitoring the network traffic.<br /><br />The URLS are either already down or cleaned during our analysis. However the filenames still gave us some clue on the styles of the attacker. For example the file extensions suggest that the payload may be a DLL file. Also \"btn_mycomputer.gif\" suggest that the payload may disguise as an image of a button in a URL. Since we are investigating for possible links to the wiper payloads, we started looking at existing samples.<br /><br />Although we were not able to find exact matches, there were a couple variants of the wiper component that matches the style. The first uses a similarly themed filename called \"<a href=\"https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/510f83af3c41f9892040a8a80b4f3a4736eebee2ec4a7d4bfee63dbe44d7ecff/analysis/\">mb_join.gif</a>\" which may be trying to disguise as an image of a join button on some mobile banking website. The other is a time triggered <a href=\"https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/265fce88baeb29cd9b962b75840eefa2ce75e2662998b1f7c4abacb71b92be7b/analysis/\">DLL sample</a>:<br /><br /><img border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/sk_wiper_time.png\" alt=\"Time trigger\" height=\"334\" width=\"564\" /><br /><br />The code above is equivalent to \"(month * 100 + day) * 100 + hour >= 32,015\" which will only be satisfied during March 20 15:00 and later.<br /><br />Besides spear phishing e-mails, not all affected systems need to get infected themselves. Some variants also wipe remote systems using credentials found in configuration files of certain SSH clients installed in infected systems.

NSHC Red Alert Team has published a detailed analysis of the malware <a href=\"http://training.nshc.net/KOR/Document/virus/20130321_320CyberTerrorIncidentResponseReportbyRedAlert%28EN%29.pdf\">here</a>. There were several hashes mentioned for the same component, which suggest multiple operations under the same campaign.<br /><br />So how did the affected companies get infected? No one knows for sure. However we came across the following <a href=\"https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/e8745c275fefc55d1217139bb770dccbdc604423d6ccf614beda5ac2eb55f2e2/analysis/\">archive</a>:<br /><br /><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/sk_wiper_rar.png\" alt=\"Archive\" height=\"310\" width=\"515\" /><br /><br />The filename of the archive roughly translate to \"The customer's account history\". As a side note, Shinhan bank was one of the affected companies according to reports.<br /><br />Those with keen eye would notice that the malware inside the archive is using double extensions combined with a very long filename to hide the real extension. This is a common social engineering tactic that started during the era of <a href=\"http://www.f-secure.com/v-descs/netsky_q.shtml\">mass mailing worms</a> almost a decade ago. Therefore we believe the archive is most likely sent as attachment in spear phishing e-mails.<br /><br />The malware has a datestamp of March 17, 2013, which is just few days before the incidents. It uses the icon of Internet Explorer and opens the following decoy upon execution:<br /><br /><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/sk_wiper_decoy.png\" alt=\"HTML decoy document\" height=\"666\" width=\"768\" /><br /><br />In the background, the malware downloads and executes the following:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hxxp://www.6885.com/uploads/fb9c6013f1b269b74c8cd139471b96fc/feng.jpg<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saved as %systemdirectory%\\hzcompl.dll<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hxxp://www.clickflower.net/board/images/start_car.gif<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saved as %systemdirectory%\\%random%.dll<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hxxp://mailimg.nate.com/mail/img/button/btn_mycomputer.gif<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saved as %systemdirectory%\\sotd.dll<br /><br />Several other HTTP requests are also made, possibly to download other dependencies of the payloads or simply to obscure the malicious requests from admins monitoring the network traffic.<br /><br />The URLS are either already down or cleaned during our analysis. However the filenames still gave us some clue on the styles of the attacker. For example the file extensions suggest that the payload may be a DLL file. Also \"btn_mycomputer.gif\" suggest that the payload may disguise as an image of a button in a URL. Since we are investigating for possible links to the wiper payloads, we started looking at existing samples.<br /><br />Although we were not able to find exact matches, there were a couple variants of the wiper component that matches the style. The first uses a similarly themed filename called \"<a href=\"https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/510f83af3c41f9892040a8a80b4f3a4736eebee2ec4a7d4bfee63dbe44d7ecff/analysis/\">mb_join.gif</a>\" which may be trying to disguise as an image of a join button on some mobile banking website. The other is a time triggered <a href=\"https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/265fce88baeb29cd9b962b75840eefa2ce75e2662998b1f7c4abacb71b92be7b/analysis/\">DLL sample</a>:<br /><br /><img border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/sk_wiper_time.png\" alt=\"Time trigger\" height=\"334\" width=\"564\" /><br /><br />The code above is equivalent to \"(month * 100 + day) * 100 + hour >= 32,015\" which will only be satisfied during March 20 15:00 and later.<br /><br />Besides spear phishing e-mails, not all affected systems need to get infected themselves. Some variants also wipe remote systems using credentials found in configuration files of certain SSH clients installed in infected systems. Therefore an affected system can simply have one of its user, who uses a vulnerable SSH client, infected for it to get toasted!<br /><br />It is interesting to note that Felix Deimel and VanDyke SSH clients as well as the RAR archive were used in the attacks. These are either third party applications or not supported by Windows natively. Not to mention the attacks specifically wipe remote Linux and Unix based systems.
