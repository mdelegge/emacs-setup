It neatly presents a historical context for modern mashups. </p><p>Looking at someone else&#8217;s creative work sometimes provokes an artist into thinking what he or she would do with that same subject, or it inspires a new twist, or even the direct thought &#8220;Gee, if I ever need to draw the face of somebody shrieking their lungs out, I am <em>definitely</em> going to remember how da Vinci did it in his cartoon for &#8216;The Battle Of Anghiari&#8217;!&#8221;</p><p>Theft is theft, and when a lazy creator blandly copies the work of another, the work usually tells the tale within five seconds. But it&#8217;s no good to recognize an influence and then dismiss the second work without thinking any deeper. That reaction is ignorant of the creative process, and it&#8217;s contemptuously dismissive of the amount of hard work and innovative thinking that the original work inspires. George Lucas himself acknowledged that &#8220;A New Hope&#8221; was hugely influenced by Kurasawa&#8217;s &#8220;The Hidden Fortress.&#8221; But would anyone deny that Episode 4 is an original work?</p><p>Today, we all acknowledge that designing software and hardware is a creative, even an artistic, endeavor. That&#8217;s a welcome change in attitude. Engineers were once perceived as just a bunch of dull technicians ticking items off of a list of features and specifications under fluorescent lighting. Now, we often think of these men and women as artisans who want to make something that functions beautifully.</p><p>If we&#8217;re going to fully embrace this new perception, however, we need to acknowledge that the artistic process is universal, whether the thing the artist creates is a single painting or 10,000,000 phones. It&#8217;s the same in Jony Ive&#8217;s day as it was in Raphael&#8217;s. Software patents, as well as the most hysterical superfans of a platform, try to pretend that art is made in a vacuum and that ideas, like real estate, exist with firm boundaries and sole ownership. Hogwash on both counts.</p><p>Yes, theft is theft. Sure, a direct, lazy copy is easy to spot. But when Google pivots their new mobile OS away from keypads and towards multitouch after they see the iPhone, and then Apple changes the iPhone&#8217;s notification system after they see Android, they&#8217;re just following in the footsteps of the Old Masters. It&#8217;s fine.</p>

I saw &#8220;Star Wars&#8221; here during its first run. This fact alone designates the Norwood Theater as a site of extreme reverence for me.</p><p>But the theater didn&#8217;t look even half this grand in 1977. At that point, it was 50 years old and had suffered through several renovations. The movie industry clobbered live stage performances, and then TV clobbered movies, and then multiplex chains and home video clobbered independently-owned second-run movie houses. At each turn, the theater&#8217;s owners needed to change the house to respond to the market and every time that happened, they had less and less money to put into the business.</p><p>Last year, its new owners finished an ambitious restoration that rewound the theater back to its roots. They tore down the tacky metal facade that covered up those magnificent arched windows, and rebuilt the tiara-like NORWOOD sign that had been long-gone by the time I appeared on the planet. They turned the second movie screen back into a balcony and fully restored and rebuilt the interior. The theater once again is capable of presenting either movies or live stage performances.</p><p>Suffice to say that the Norwood Theater of 2013 in no way matches my cherished memories from 1977. This sort of thing <em>sucks</em> when you discover that corporate fiends have twisted your neighborhood playground into an Olive Garden. But when thoughtful caretakers go to great trouble and expense to restore a theater to a glory that you yourself never got to experience&#8230;you&#8217;re going to be okay with that.</p><p>It&#8217;s interesting to see the place like this. &#8220;Like this&#8221; meaning &#8220;Not shabby and tacky.&#8221; For most of my childhood, it was a theater that was forced to make a saleable product out of whatever scraps the multiplexes left behind: the lips, ears, and other unmentionables of the film industry. The 2013 incarnation of the Norwood Theater looks like the sort of class joint that won&#8217;t sell you a ticket if you&#8217;re only wearing a wet bathing suit. I can&#8217;t wait to attend an event there and check out the interior.</p>

Anyway, I can do a pretty good Leno imitation. It was a lot of fun to be him—also much easier, particularly in constructing “his” monologue for that night. I have a filter mechanism in my head every night when I put together the monologue for our show: If I can imagine Jay Leno telling a joke, then I won’t do it, even if it’s a good joke. There are three ways he does a joke, every single time, always with the same rhythm. The difference between Leno’s jokes and Letterman’s jokes is like the difference between Celebrity Jeopardy! and regular Jeopardy! During Celebrity Jeopardy! anyone could get all the answers; there’s an accessibility that makes you feel like you’re smart. I think Leno’s jokes are similar in that way. Real Jeopardy! requires an attempt at greater mind function.</p><p><a href='http://www.playboy.com/playground/view/playboy-interview-jimmy-kimmel'>Playboy Interview: Jimmy Kimmel</a>.</p></blockquote><p>That&#8217;s an excellent way of putting it, don&#8217;t you think? I prefer Letterman to Leno in part because Dave forces me to pay attention. If I&#8217;m reading email and only half-listening, I might miss out on a crucial line that explains why he got another big laugh three jokes later.</p>

News</a>.</p><p></em></p></blockquote><p>Movie pitch:</p><p>As he has done a dozen times a day for the past twenty years, a cleric pulls another dusty box of Church documents from storage and brings it to a large work table. A crackling paper label indicates that it had been moved here from the library of a shuttered monastery in 1891 and forgotten. He starts cataloguing its contents and prioritizing them for conservation and archiving.</p><p>He&#8217;s handled thousands of documents spanning every age and form of written communication. So when he spots a set of papers with a seal and device he&#8217;s never seen before, it grabs his immediate attention. He starts reading. Ten minutes later, he bursts into an office located a twenty minute walk away. He throws the document onto the desk of a colleague and insists that he immediately  begin verifing his own loose translation of its contents.</p><p>It takes a year for the document to be validated but by early February of 2013, skepticism has turned to shock and chills. The Pope is briefed in secrecy.</p><p>The document <em>definitely</em> dates back to the fifth century and it was <em>definitely</em> signed by Julius II, aka &#8220;The Warrior Pope,&#8221; who was known to be ruthless and relentless in securing the glory and independence of the Church against all enemies, real and imagined. It&#8217;s a contract that promises the security and supremacy of the Church. In exchange, Satan will return and claim the soul of the sitting Pope exactly 1500 years to the day after Julius&#8217; death. If payment is not made, he will destroy the entirety of the Church in hellfire.</p><p>It was written with a kind of pigment unknown by Man.</p><p>Julius II died on February 21, 513 AD. Witnesses to his death attributed his deathbed babblings of dark covenants to the fever that claimed his life.</p><p>The College of Cardinals only learns of these facts on February 12, the day after the Pope&#8217;s briefing, sudden abdication, and immediate disappearance. The last person to see him inside the Vatican was a telephone repairman working in the residential wing. The Pope traded him the jawbone of the apostle Bartholomew for 100 Euro and the man&#8217;s street clothes.</p><p>The unusual circumstances greatly complicates the process of choosing one among themselves to become the next Pope. A fistfight almost breaks out before someone points out the lone empty seat in the papal conclave: it&#8217;s the one assigned to Cardinal Herbert Blebbenfelder, Archbishop of Scottsdale, Arizona. He cancelled his trip to Rome because he&#8217;s scared to fly, his asthma was acting up, and he didn&#8217;t trust his bishops to take proper care of his pet birds while he was gone.</p><p>A plume of white smoke wafts from the chimney of the Sistine Chapel. A new Pope has been named!</p><p>Don Knotts IS: &#8220;The Shakiest Pope In The West&#8221;!</p>

Bill Hicks died in 1994 at age 32 and he still looms large. His comedy was so very intense. But his anger wasn&#8217;t just a prop; it was a lens that brought a clarity to every thought he expressed and intensified the light he was shining on an idea.</p><p>&#8220;Artistic Roll Call&#8221; is&#8230;really something. Mr. Hicks has some rather strong opinions on Jay Leno and the direction that he chose for himself and his comedy. Yes, I know: the thought &#8220;Jay Leno is to comedy what Olive Garden is to dining out&#8221; is as overplayed today as &#8220;Hey, what&#8217;s the deal with those tiny packets of peanuts they give you on airplanes?&#8221;</p><p>It&#8217;s noteworthy for two reasons: first, this was recorded sometime just after Leno had taken over the Tonight Show. At the time, he was talking about something that was very much on his mind, as opposed to going to a cheap and easy putdown.</p><p>Secondly&#8230;oh, wow. Just <em>listen</em> to him. This is an outpouring of genuine anger. Anger that a once-great comedian had chosen to change his comedic voice into a marketable product. Disappointment that Leno had seen any value whatsoever in doing commercials.</p><p>And it went even deeper than that! The rest of Hicks&#8217; work makes it clear that this bit also reflected his frustration in our national character. Why did Leno make these choices? <em>Because they work.</em> Broad, harmless humor entertains way more people than the stuff that&#8217;s targeted and meant to bruise. Why was Leno shilling Doritos? It was a Sound Business Decision. A big check for not a whole lot of his time, and all the while, it got his face out there in front of people.</p><p>I don&#8217;t agree with everything Hicks says on the CDs and videos of his standup. He also had a great bit about the JFK assassination: &#8220;If you go to Dealey Plaza, there&#8217;s a museum on the sixth floor,&#8221; he says. &#8220;They&#8217;ve recreated the so-called &#8216;sniper&#8217;s nest&#8217; exactly the way it was on the day of the assassination. And you know it&#8217;s completely accurate because&#8230;<em>Oswald isn&#8217;t in it.</em>&#8221;</p><p>I&#8217;ll go ahead and embed this clip. Warning: The audio isn&#8217;t work-safe.</p><p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/11Fl9ZVJ7B8?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span></p><p>Let&#8217;s not get into a long digression about the assassination. To conspiracists, I will just ask &#8220;What about the long, skinny package wrapped in brown paper that Oswald brought in to work that morning?&#8221; (yes, that really happened) and move on.</p><p>I&#8217;m also not 100% on board with bashing Leno at least not (holy mother of God) this savagely. True, I haven&#8217;t had any use for his comedy since he stopped doing the Letterman show. But being a comedian isn&#8217;t like being a company CEO, where you&#8217;re well-insulated from the fallout from your decisions. Leno appears to be happy. He gets to work on cars, tell jokes at 11:30 PM, and also do several standup gigs a week. I think the canonical line on Jay&#8217;s career comes from <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007PM01M8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=B007PM01M8&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;tag=andihnscelwas-20\" target=\"_blank\">Bill Carter&#8217;s terrific book about the Late Night Wars II</a>, quoting a producer who acknowledges Jay&#8217;s ratings but then says &#8220;at the end of the day, though, who would you rather be? Jay Leno&#8230;or David Letterman?&#8221;</p><p>Yes, his material is about offering audiences some distraction, not depth. But Leno doesn&#8217;t seem to care about that. So&#8230;<em>shrug.</em></p><p>I&#8217;m fascinated by the construction of this rant, though. It&#8217;s utterly brutal. There aren&#8217;t even many jokes in this bit. He just keeps expressing his anger and his disappointment in different and novel ways. We shouldn&#8217;t call it a rant. It&#8217;s not unfocused, out-of-control rage; the bit works because Hicks is in full control throughout. A great standup comic is just like a great magician. It&#8217;s all about maintaining control of the audience. Hicks proceeds through his material, but always with his antennae fully extended and maintaining a sharp, moment-my-moment read on where their perceptions are, and how best to manipulate those perceptions.</p><p>And that&#8217;s how he avoids turning anger and frustration into a tool towards uncovering greater truth, instead of a catchphrase that lets the audience and himself avoid it entirely. Sam Kinison was funny as hell, but he asked so little of an audience. When he screamed into the microphone, the audience was relieved, almost; it was his signature, on the level of Steve Martin yelling &#8220;Well, ex-cuuuuuuusssseeeee <em>meeeeeeee!!!</em>&#8221; Late in his career, the scream was a welcome sign that this was all stagecraft. The knives onstage are all made out of rubber and that soon, the curtain will rise again and Caesar will be alive to take his bows.</p><p>No such luck with Hicks. I enjoy his performances for the sounds from the audiences as much as anything else. Unified cheers and laughter are rare; usually, the laughter is mixed with discomfort, and there are many nervous silences. During the &#8220;JFK&#8221; bit, I feel as though Hicks is angry at <em>me.</em> I want to clear my throat and stammer and say &#8220;Well, all right, I believe what the government is telling me about the JFK assassination, but I don&#8217;t believe <em>everything</em> they tell me. Except when they tell me what kinds of food are safe to eat. And what level of regular maintenance is OK for an airplane. And&#8230;&#8221;</p><p>(Oh, crap.)</p><p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry,&#8221; he reassures the audience, when he senses that he&#8217;s dug himself into a deep hole. &#8220;I&#8217;ll start telling d*** jokes soon.&#8221;</p><p>I mentioned earlier that I respect the fact that Leno made his choices and accepted the consequences. The same&#8217;s true of Hicks. Leno wanted an audience, to the extreme of completely desaturating his act to an institutional shade of beige. Hicks wanted authenticity, to the extreme of making it hard to create material that would fill every seat in a US theater. Or, pursue any source of income away from the stage of a comedy club. Barring an absolutely stunning statement of theological reversal, Hicks couldn&#8217;t have pursued TV (unless it was unsponsored, and aired on a network owned by an independent company).</p><p>If he&#8217;d lived, I think his decades of onstage sincerity and integrity would have finally paid off. Not because American audience are any more enlightened today. Oh, wow, my head spins just thinking about what he&#8217;d be saying about our &#8220;Hope And Change&#8221; President&#8217;s use of drone strikes!</p><p>This is an age when you can do almost as well with a small audience of people who absolutely love you as you can with a large audience of people who think you&#8217;re marginally less objectionable than whoever&#8217;s on the other channel. His access to his audience wouldn&#8217;t have been controlled by any large company (a network, a promoter, a record label). He could sell tickets, audio, and video directly to his fans. </p><p>And the power of social networks to spread something around to millions of people isn&#8217;t compatible with &#8220;bland and populist&#8221; material When was the last time someone Tweeted a link and said &#8220;Oh, wow, you HAVE to see what Leno said in his monologue last night!&#8221;?</p><p>Hicks seems like a reminder that you often have to keep the faith that a longterm equity investment will eventually pay off. All of the Hicks standup material we have is, alas, all of the material we&#8217;ll ever have. The point of view and the voice he had built after 15 years was amazing. And it was strong footing for whatever he would have built on top of it. </p><p>32 seems to be an age when many successful creative people get a little antsy and bored, and they start questioning what&#8217;s been working so far. They&#8217;ve built up a hell of a lot of knowledge and experience. What do they want to do with it? Often, they either try to use those same skills in different ways, or they try to augment what they have by developing a different set of skills.</p><p>When you listen to a few hours of Hicks&#8217; released standup, you come away (a) hoarse from laughter, (b) profoundly impressed, and (c) aware that there was some distance between Hicks and the audience. He feels a frustration with the world, and the people in those seats are part of the problem. </p><p>Richard Pryor, at the height of his powers, often found a way to quietly suggest &#8212; so subtly that you didn&#8217;t even think of it until long after &#8212; that you and he were there in the room to start working on a solution. Parts of his standup films are genuinely cathartic.</p><p>So I wonder what he would have built by age 50. The knowledge that you have an audience can drive you to narcissism. Or, it can drive you towards introspection. Here you have 1000 people who will be hanging on your every word for 70 minutes. What should you do with their attention? What would you like them to be thinking about the next morning?</p><p>It&#8217;s perfectly fine to send an audience away thinking nothing more substantive than &#8220;I definitely got $75 worth of entertainment for my $50 ticket.&#8221; One might even make a credible case that people pay $50 to attend a comedy show with a view towards laughing hard. I&#8217;m fascinated by Bill Hicks, but the fact that most of the other comedians I love &#8220;merely&#8221; entertain me shouldn&#8217;t be considered a mark against them.</p><p>And of course, dying young is the ultimate rose-colored filter. Every brave person becomes a colossus and every talented performer becomes a genius. All because of the feats they never had a chance to achieve, and the works they never had a chance to create. The bizarre dementia of a fan is that we keep expecting great things from the ones we worship, even long after they&#8217;ve died.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005L6BMNW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=B005L6BMNW&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;tag=andihnscelwas-20\">Preview &#8220;Artistic Roll Call&#8221; on the Amazon MP3 Store</a>.

(1) The album is filled with clever, funny songs; (2) but &#8220;White Wine In The Sun&#8221; is just a flat-out beautiful piece of music; and (3) as a bonus&#8230;it&#8217;s actually a Christmas song.</p><p>Add Tim to my growing list of &#8220;whiplash musicians.&#8221; I went from not having the slightest inkling that he existed, to hearing my first Tim Minchin song, to owning everything of his that was available in the Amazon MP3 Store, to being very sad that I then had to wait for him to release his next album just like every other Tim Minchin fan&#8230;all in the space of about an hour.</p><p>I absolutely freakin&#8217; <em>love</em> Tim Minchin. My first Tim Minchin song was &#8220;Prejudice.&#8221; It&#8217;s catchy, and funny, and thus it&#8217;s exactly the sort of link you&#8217;d receive as an IM on a slow weekday mid-afternoon. Mr. Minchin was nice enough to post a video of the song to his YouTube channel, so I&#8217;ll just go ahead and embed it right here-ish:</p><p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/KVN_0qvuhhw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span></p><p>That&#8217;s, like, nine pounds of clever in a five pound bag. I had gone my entire life without realizing that &#8220;Ginger&#8221; was an anagram of a highly offensive word. And now, it&#8217;s difficult for me to think of it as anything else. It serves as a valuable reminder that wordplay, like all active sports, often leads to careless injury. So if you&#8217;re going to let your son or daughter go out and spoonerize with other children, make sure they&#8217;re wearing protection.</p><p>(Aside: I had no idea until very recently that &#8220;ginger&#8221; is used as a derogatory term for redheads. Is that a European thing? [Edited: or an Australian thing?] It isn&#8217;t an American thing, right? We had red-headed kids in my school and yeah, I think many of them got teased. But only under the eternal rubric of &#8220;we&#8217;re 284 children plucked from our safe and familiar surroundings; we&#8217;re hoping that if we ruthlessly tease any kid who&#8217;s in any way different, maybe nobody will sense how terrified we all are.&#8221; </p><p>I never even heard of that use of &#8220;ginger&#8221; until a few years ago&#8230;and I had thought that my experiences with the Mean Kids faction of my junior high school had left me with an exhaustive database of derogatory insults. True, I didn&#8217;t have red hair. But I also had no developmental disabilities nor any desire to kiss boys, and the Mean Kids sure didn&#8217;t let <em>those</em> details stop them.</p><p>In a way, this fresh use of &#8220;Ginger&#8221; is reassuring. It&#8217;s additional evidence that butt-headed prejudice has no rhyme or reason. It&#8217;s just a kind of free-flailing tendril of idiocy that doesn&#8217;t really care what it latches onto. Now that I know I can&#8217;t do anything to personally eradicate prejudice on a worldwide scale, the pressure&#8217;s kind of off, isn&#8217;t it? End of aside.)</p><p>When you&#8217;re done laughing at &#8220;Prejudice,&#8221; switch off the part of your brain that understands English and listen to the song again, solely as a piece of music. That&#8217;s some powerful late-Seventies arena-style singer-songwriting, isn&#8217;t it? Most of Minchin&#8217;s songs remind me of one of Jeff Koons&#8217; monumental-scale balloon animals. It&#8217;s a colorful item of obvious whimsy. But the thing&#8217;s twenty feet tall and it&#8217;s made out of stainless steel. The thing is structurally-sound, thanks to the impressive amount of engineering and fabrication work that went into its production.</p><p>&#8220;White Wine In The Sun&#8221; is a pretty, pretty song. It packs a punch, too. The best way to describe it is as &#8220;A Christmas song for nice people who happen to be atheists.&#8221;</p><p>I hope my atheist friends aren&#8217;t offended by that turn of phrase, which I&#8217;ve been in love with from the moment I first encountered it. I saw it in a post by an atheist, who used it to describe his default appraisal of religious folk: &#8220;Nice people who happen to believe in God.&#8221; It&#8217;s perfect. I think this basic form describes the vast majority of people.</p><p>First and foremost: &#8220;Nice People.&#8221; Regardless of what sort of jewelry we wear around our necks or what kind of bumper sticker we put on our cars, we know that we all agreed to at least <em>try</em> to be nice to each other, as one of the simple Terms And Conditions associated with the license for human DNA. If you&#8217;re upset about that, then you should have read the whole document before clicking the &#8220;I have read and agree to all of these terms&#8221; and then hitting &#8220;Install.&#8221;</p><p>Then comes the &#8220;&#8230;who happen to&#8230;&#8221; bit. However you choose to perceive the big picture of our reality, primarily you&#8217;d like to be define yourself as a Nice Person, instead of being perceived through the weird veil of a clumsy adjective. Further, there&#8217;s no need to describe atheism or religion in anything other than a neutral tone.</p><p>At its core, though, this construct underscores the premise that a nice person is a nice person because of who they are and how they treat people. Maybe their nature has been positively shaped by religion, maybe it&#8217;s been positively shaped by rational influences (again, going solely from a non-judgmental dictionary definition of &#8220;rational&#8221;). So long as they&#8217;re nice people, what does it matter?</p><p>The singer of &#8220;White Wine In The Sun&#8221; kicks the song off by saying &#8220;I really like Christmas.&#8221; Then he calmly states his objections to religious holidays. And although he makes several valid points against religion specifically, they&#8217;re gentle and subtle ones, and he&#8217;s only mentioning them in passing.</p><p>He saves his intense emotions for the main bit, where he explains why he treasures this holiday: he gets to spend time with his parents, his brothers and sisters, and his Gran, all together in the same place. He&#8217;s filled with gratitude for this regularly-scheduled day filled with warm feelings of love and support and family and belonging.</p><p>What a marvelous sense of perspective. An airliner pumps tons of greenhouse gases into the air as it crisscrosses the country. But it brings you home. On that basis, you can only be grateful that it exists.</p><p>&#8220;White Wine In The Sun&#8221; is a live recording and the song cast an obvious spell on the audience. The audience had heard a dozen funny songs before this one. During the beginning of &#8220;White Wine,&#8221; they chuckled at all of the right parts. Those who had never heard the song before, however, seemed to grow a bit uneasy; the funny bits were more like clever observations than actual jokes. And soon, the funny bits disappeared entirely. You can almost hear the thoughts going through their heads: &#8220;Is Tim&#8230;being sincere? Is he trying to make me feel a genuine, cathartic emotion? Hey, where&#8217;s that crying sound coming from? Crap! It&#8217;s <em>me!</em>&#8221;</p><p>Sure, I&#8217;ll admit it: I was powerfully moved when I reached the core of the song, and he started singing about his family. I&#8217;m very sad to say that I&#8217;ve shared my last Christmas ever with some of the people on that list of &#8220;Dad and brothers and sisters and Gram and Mom.&#8221; I still miss those people a lot, even years after losing them.</p><p>Just when I was thinking &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe I got through that without crying,&#8221; he started singing about his daughter. And that, dear readers, was when I was very, very glad that I was alone in the room.</p><p>I absolutely freakin&#8217; <em>love</em> Tim Minchin.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005L6BMNW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=B005L6BMNW&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;tag=andihnscelwas-20\" target=\"_blank\">Sample &#8220;White Wine In The Sun&#8221; on the Amazon MP3 store</a>.

I stop when the screen is a spotless mirror, the aluminum is a smooth, continuous tone of grey, and I&#8217;ve teased all the visible crumbs and dust and arm hairs from the keyboard.</p><p>Then I push the Power button and get going again. Yes, the MacBook performs better after a restart. But the point of all this is just performing the symbolic ritual of a spiritual cleansing. I have scrubbed away all of the crumbs and failure. Every nonsense obstacle is in the trash bin with the damp paper towel. I now have a fresh space in which Wonderful Things can be built. Then I put my head down and I get back to work.</p><p>It&#8217;s a brain hack, I know. The joy of the whole &#8220;day to night to day again&#8221; pattern of life is that bit in the middle: the gap that occurs after whatever happened and before whatever happens next. The gap encourages you to remember that if you fell short of your goals on a Monday, well, there&#8217;s nothing stopping you from achieving everything hoped and then some on Tuesday.</p><p>So I stop. And I clean my MacBook. As I fold the paper towel up and clear away the line of crumbs that accumulated in the hinge under the screen, I feel as though the damnably-long period of hard work without real results is over. Now, I&#8217;m just a guy wiping down a keyboard. I&#8217;ll start all over again. Only this time, I won&#8217;t have dots of aerosol-propelled Diet Dr. Pepper staring back at me as I write. And! I don&#8217;t know who it was that left this preliminary draft on my hard drive, but I can see that there&#8217;s plenty of good stuff in there and it&#8217;s not so far away from the final draft that&#8217;s been eluding me for several days.</p><p>If nothing else? My MacBook is clean. That&#8217;s something, isn&#8217;t it?</p><p>Consider this an amplification &#8212; for my benefit as well as yours &#8212; of what I posted last year, about <a href=\"http://ihnatko.com/2011/04/18/fast-eddie-lets-play-some-pool/\" target=\"_blank\">the inspirational possibilities of &#8220;The Hustler&#8221;</a>.</p>

A crackling paper label indicates that it had been moved here from the library of a shuttered monastery in 1891 and forgotten. He starts cataloguing its contents and prioritizing them for conservation and archiving.</p><p>He’s handled thousands of documents spanning every age and form of written communication. So when he spots a set of papers with a seal and device he’s never seen before, it grabs his immediate attention. He starts reading. Ten minutes later, he bursts into an office located a twenty minute walk away. He throws the document onto the desk of a colleague and insists that he immediately  begin verifing his own loose translation of its contents.</p><p>It takes a year for the document to be validated but by early February of 2013, skepticism has turned to shock and chills. The Pope is briefed in secrecy.</p><p>The document <em>definitely</em> dates back to the fifth century and it was <em>definitely</em> signed by Julius II, aka “The Warrior Pope,” who was known to be ruthless and relentless in securing the glory and independence of the Church against all enemies, real and imagined. It’s a contract that promises the security and supremacy of the Church. In exchange, Satan will return and claim the soul of the sitting Pope exactly 1500 years to the day after Julius’ death. If payment is not made, he will destroy the entirety of the Church in hellfire.</p><p>It was written with a kind of pigment unknown by Man.</p><p>Julius II died on February 21, 513 AD. Witnesses to his death attributed his deathbed babblings of dark covenants to the fever that claimed his life.</p><p>The College of Cardinals only learns of these facts on February 12, the day after the Pope’s briefing, sudden abdication, and immediate disappearance. The last person to see him inside the Vatican was a telephone repairman working in the residential wing. The Pope traded him the jawbone of the apostle Bartholomew for 100 Euro and the man’s street clothes.</p><p>The unusual circumstances greatly complicates the process of choosing one among themselves to become the next Pope.

A crackling paper label indicates that it had been moved here from the library of a shuttered monastery in 1891 and forgotten. He starts cataloguing its contents and prioritizing them for conservation and archiving.</p><p>He&#8217;s handled thousands of documents spanning every age and form of written communication. So when he spots a set of papers with a seal and device he&#8217;s never seen before, it grabs his immediate attention. He starts reading. Ten minutes later, he bursts into an office located a twenty minute walk away. He throws the document onto the desk of a colleague and insists that he immediately  begin verifing his own loose translation of its contents.</p><p>It takes a year for the document to be validated but by early February of 2013, skepticism has turned to shock and chills. The Pope is briefed in secrecy.</p><p>The document <em>definitely</em> dates back to the fifth century and it was <em>definitely</em> signed by Julius II, aka &#8220;The Warrior Pope,&#8221; who was known to be ruthless and relentless in securing the glory and independence of the Church against all enemies, real and imagined. It&#8217;s a contract that promises the security and supremacy of the Church. In exchange, Satan will return and claim the soul of the sitting Pope exactly 1500 years to the day after Julius&#8217; death. If payment is not made, he will destroy the entirety of the Church in hellfire.</p><p>It was written with a kind of pigment unknown by Man.</p><p>Julius II died on February 21, 513 AD. Witnesses to his death attributed his deathbed babblings of dark covenants to the fever that claimed his life.</p><p>The College of Cardinals only learns of these facts on February 12, the day after the Pope&#8217;s briefing, sudden abdication, and immediate disappearance. The last person to see him inside the Vatican was a telephone repairman working in the residential wing. The Pope traded him the jawbone of the apostle Bartholomew for 100 Euro and the man&#8217;s street clothes.</p><p>The unusual circumstances greatly complicates the process of choosing one among themselves to become the next Pope. A fistfight almost breaks out before someone points out the lone empty seat in the papal conclave: it&#8217;s the one assigned to Cardinal Herbert Blebbenfelder, Archbishop of Scottsdale, Arizona.

Bill Hicks died in 1994 at age 32 and he still looms large. His comedy was so very intense. But his anger wasn’t just a prop; it was a lens that brought a clarity to every thought he expressed and intensified the light he was shining on an idea.</p><p>“Artistic Roll Call” is…really something. Mr. Hicks has some rather strong opinions on Jay Leno and the direction that he chose for himself and his comedy. Yes, I know: the thought “Jay Leno is to comedy what Olive Garden is to dining out” is as overplayed today as “Hey, what’s the deal with those tiny packets of peanuts they give you on airplanes?”</p><p>It’s noteworthy for two reasons: first, this was recorded sometime just after Leno had taken over the Tonight Show. At the time, he was talking about something that was very much on his mind, as opposed to going to a cheap and easy putdown.</p><p>Secondly…oh, wow. Just <em>listen</em> to him. This is an outpouring of genuine anger. Anger that a once-great comedian had chosen to change his comedic voice into a marketable product. Disappointment that Leno had seen any value whatsoever in doing commercials.</p><p>And it went even deeper than that! The rest of Hicks’ work makes it clear that this bit also reflected his frustration in our national character. Why did Leno make these choices? <em>Because they work.</em> Broad, harmless humor entertains way more people than the stuff that’s targeted and meant to bruise. Why was Leno shilling Doritos? It was a Sound Business Decision. A big check for not a whole lot of his time, and all the while, it got his face out there in front of people.</p><p>I don’t agree with everything Hicks says on the CDs and videos of his standup. He also had a great bit about the JFK assassination: “If you go to Dealey Plaza, there’s a museum on the sixth floor,” he says. “They’ve recreated the so-called ‘sniper’s nest’ exactly the way it was on the day of the assassination. And you know it’s completely accurate because…<em>Oswald isn’t in it.</em>”</p><p>I’ll go ahead and embed this clip. Warning: The audio isn’t work-safe.</p><p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/11Fl9ZVJ7B8?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span></p><p>Let’s not get into a long digression about the assassination. To conspiracists, I will just ask “What about the long, skinny package wrapped in brown paper that Oswald brought in to work that morning?” (yes, that really happened) and move on.</p><p>I’m also not 100% on board with bashing Leno at least not (holy mother of God) this savagely. True, I haven’t had any use for his comedy since he stopped doing the Letterman show. But being a comedian isn’t like being a company CEO, where you’re well-insulated from the fallout from your decisions. Leno appears to be happy. He gets to work on cars, tell jokes at 11:30 PM, and also do several standup gigs a week. I think the canonical line on Jay’s career comes from <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007PM01M8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B007PM01M8&linkCode=as2&tag=andihnscelwas-20\" target=\"_blank\">Bill Carter’s terrific book about the Late Night Wars II</a>, quoting a producer who acknowledges Jay’s ratings but then says “at the end of the day, though, who would you rather be? Jay Leno…or David Letterman?”</p><p>Yes, his material is about offering audiences some distraction, not depth. But Leno doesn’t seem to care about that. So…<em>shrug.</em></p><p>I’m fascinated by the construction of this rant, though. It’s utterly brutal. There aren’t even many jokes in this bit. He just keeps expressing his anger and his disappointment in different and novel ways. We shouldn’t call it a rant. It’s not unfocused, out-of-control rage; the bit works because Hicks is in full control throughout. A great standup comic is just like a great magician. It’s all about maintaining control of the audience. Hicks proceeds through his material, but always with his antennae fully extended and maintaining a sharp, moment-my-moment read on where their perceptions are, and how best to manipulate those perceptions.</p><p>And that’s how he avoids turning anger and frustration into a tool towards uncovering greater truth, instead of a catchphrase that lets the audience and himself avoid it entirely. Sam Kinison was funny as hell, but he asked so little of an audience. When he screamed into the microphone, the audience was relieved, almost; it was his signature, on the level of Steve Martin yelling “Well, ex-cuuuuuuusssseeeee <em>meeeeeeee!!!</em>” Late in his career, the scream was a welcome sign that this was all stagecraft. The knives onstage are all made out of rubber and that soon, the curtain will rise again and Caesar will be alive to take his bows.</p><p>No such luck with Hicks. I enjoy his performances for the sounds from the audiences as much as anything else. Unified cheers and laughter are rare; usually, the laughter is mixed with discomfort, and there are many nervous silences. During the “JFK” bit, I feel as though Hicks is angry at <em>me.</em> I want to clear my throat and stammer and say “Well, all right, I believe what the government is telling me about the JFK assassination, but I don’t believe <em>everything</em> they tell me. Except when they tell me what kinds of food are safe to eat. And what level of regular maintenance is OK for an airplane. And…”</p><p>(Oh, crap.)</p><p>“Don’t worry,” he reassures the audience, when he senses that he’s dug himself into a deep hole. “I’ll start telling d*** jokes soon.”</p><p>I mentioned earlier that I respect the fact that Leno made his choices and accepted the consequences. The same’s true of Hicks. Leno wanted an audience, to the extreme of completely desaturating his act to an institutional shade of beige. Hicks wanted authenticity, to the extreme of making it hard to create material that would fill every seat in a US theater. Or, pursue any source of income away from the stage of a comedy club. Barring an absolutely stunning statement of theological reversal, Hicks couldn’t have pursued TV (unless it was unsponsored, and aired on a network owned by an independent company).</p><p>If he’d lived, I think his decades of onstage sincerity and integrity would have finally paid off. Not because American audience are any more enlightened today. Oh, wow, my head spins just thinking about what he’d be saying about our “Hope And Change” President’s use of drone strikes!</p><p>This is an age when you can do almost as well with a small audience of people who absolutely love you as you can with a large audience of people who think you’re marginally less objectionable than whoever’s on the other channel. His access to his audience wouldn’t have been controlled by any large company (a network, a promoter, a record label). He could sell tickets, audio, and video directly to his fans. </p><p>And the power of social networks to spread something around to millions of people isn’t compatible with “bland and populist” material When was the last time someone Tweeted a link and said “Oh, wow, you HAVE to see what Leno said in his monologue last night!”?</p><p>Hicks seems like a reminder that you often have to keep the faith that a longterm equity investment will eventually pay off. All of the Hicks standup material we have is, alas, all of the material we’ll ever have. The point of view and the voice he had built after 15 years was amazing. And it was strong footing for whatever he would have built on top of it. </p><p>32 seems to be an age when many successful creative people get a little antsy and bored, and they start questioning what’s been working so far. They’ve built up a hell of a lot of knowledge and experience. What do they want to do with it? Often, they either try to use those same skills in different ways, or they try to augment what they have by developing a different set of skills.</p><p>When you listen to a few hours of Hicks’ released standup, you come away (a) hoarse from laughter, (b) profoundly impressed, and (c) aware that there was some distance between Hicks and the audience. He feels a frustration with the world, and the people in those seats are part of the problem. </p><p>Richard Pryor, at the height of his powers, often found a way to quietly suggest — so subtly that you didn’t even think of it until long after — that you and he were there in the room to start working on a solution. Parts of his standup films are genuinely cathartic.</p><p>So I wonder what he would have built by age 50. The knowledge that you have an audience can drive you to narcissism. Or, it can drive you towards introspection. Here you have 1000 people who will be hanging on your every word for 70 minutes. What should you do with their attention? What would you like them to be thinking about the next morning?</p><p>It’s perfectly fine to send an audience away thinking nothing more substantive than “I definitely got $75 worth of entertainment for my $50 ticket.” One might even make a credible case that people pay $50 to attend a comedy show with a view towards laughing hard.

Bill Hicks died in 1994 at age 32 and he still looms large. His comedy was so very intense. But his anger wasn&#8217;t just a prop; it was a lens that brought a clarity to every thought he expressed and intensified the light he was shining on an idea.</p><p>&#8220;Artistic Roll Call&#8221; is&#8230;really something. Mr. Hicks has some rather strong opinions on Jay Leno and the direction that he chose for himself and his comedy. Yes, I know: the thought &#8220;Jay Leno is to comedy what Olive Garden is to dining out&#8221; is as overplayed today as &#8220;Hey, what&#8217;s the deal with those tiny packets of peanuts they give you on airplanes?&#8221;</p><p>It&#8217;s noteworthy for two reasons: first, this was recorded sometime just after Leno had taken over the Tonight Show. At the time, he was talking about something that was very much on his mind, as opposed to going to a cheap and easy putdown.</p><p>Secondly&#8230;oh, wow. Just <em>listen</em> to him. This is an outpouring of genuine anger. Anger that a once-great comedian had chosen to change his comedic voice into a marketable product. Disappointment that Leno had seen any value whatsoever in doing commercials.</p><p>And it went even deeper than that! The rest of Hicks&#8217; work makes it clear that this bit also reflected his frustration in our national character. Why did Leno make these choices? <em>Because they work.</em> Broad, harmless humor entertains way more people than the stuff that&#8217;s targeted and meant to bruise. Why was Leno shilling Doritos? It was a Sound Business Decision. A big check for not a whole lot of his time, and all the while, it got his face out there in front of people.</p><p>I don&#8217;t agree with everything Hicks says on the CDs and videos of his standup. He also had a great bit about the JFK assassination: &#8220;If you go to Dealey Plaza, there&#8217;s a museum on the sixth floor,&#8221; he says. &#8220;They&#8217;ve recreated the so-called &#8216;sniper&#8217;s nest&#8217; exactly the way it was on the day of the assassination. And you know it&#8217;s completely accurate because&#8230;<em>Oswald isn&#8217;t in it.</em>&#8221;</p><p>I&#8217;ll go ahead and embed this clip. Warning: The audio isn&#8217;t work-safe.</p><p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/11Fl9ZVJ7B8?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span></p><p>Let&#8217;s not get into a long digression about the assassination. To conspiracists, I will just ask &#8220;What about the long, skinny package wrapped in brown paper that Oswald brought in to work that morning?&#8221; (yes, that really happened) and move on.</p><p>I&#8217;m also not 100% on board with bashing Leno at least not (holy mother of God) this savagely. True, I haven&#8217;t had any use for his comedy since he stopped doing the Letterman show. But being a comedian isn&#8217;t like being a company CEO, where you&#8217;re well-insulated from the fallout from your decisions. Leno appears to be happy. He gets to work on cars, tell jokes at 11:30 PM, and also do several standup gigs a week. I think the canonical line on Jay&#8217;s career comes from <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007PM01M8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=B007PM01M8&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;tag=andihnscelwas-20\" target=\"_blank\">Bill Carter&#8217;s terrific book about the Late Night Wars II</a>, quoting a producer who acknowledges Jay&#8217;s ratings but then says &#8220;at the end of the day, though, who would you rather be? Jay Leno&#8230;or David Letterman?&#8221;</p><p>Yes, his material is about offering audiences some distraction, not depth. But Leno doesn&#8217;t seem to care about that. So&#8230;<em>shrug.</em></p><p>I&#8217;m fascinated by the construction of this rant, though. It&#8217;s utterly brutal. There aren&#8217;t even many jokes in this bit. He just keeps expressing his anger and his disappointment in different and novel ways. We shouldn&#8217;t call it a rant. It&#8217;s not unfocused, out-of-control rage; the bit works because Hicks is in full control throughout. A great standup comic is just like a great magician. It&#8217;s all about maintaining control of the audience. Hicks proceeds through his material, but always with his antennae fully extended and maintaining a sharp, moment-my-moment read on where their perceptions are, and how best to manipulate those perceptions.</p><p>And that&#8217;s how he avoids turning anger and frustration into a tool towards uncovering greater truth, instead of a catchphrase that lets the audience and himself avoid it entirely. Sam Kinison was funny as hell, but he asked so little of an audience. When he screamed into the microphone, the audience was relieved, almost; it was his signature, on the level of Steve Martin yelling &#8220;Well, ex-cuuuuuuusssseeeee <em>meeeeeeee!!!</em>&#8221; Late in his career, the scream was a welcome sign that this was all stagecraft. The knives onstage are all made out of rubber and that soon, the curtain will rise again and Caesar will be alive to take his bows.</p><p>No such luck with Hicks. I enjoy his performances for the sounds from the audiences as much as anything else. Unified cheers and laughter are rare; usually, the laughter is mixed with discomfort, and there are many nervous silences. During the &#8220;JFK&#8221; bit, I feel as though Hicks is angry at <em>me.</em> I want to clear my throat and stammer and say &#8220;Well, all right, I believe what the government is telling me about the JFK assassination, but I don&#8217;t believe <em>everything</em> they tell me. Except when they tell me what kinds of food are safe to eat. And what level of regular maintenance is OK for an airplane. And&#8230;&#8221;</p><p>(Oh, crap.)</p><p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry,&#8221; he reassures the audience, when he senses that he&#8217;s dug himself into a deep hole. &#8220;I&#8217;ll start telling d*** jokes soon.&#8221;</p><p>I mentioned earlier that I respect the fact that Leno made his choices and accepted the consequences. The same&#8217;s true of Hicks. Leno wanted an audience, to the extreme of completely desaturating his act to an institutional shade of beige. Hicks wanted authenticity, to the extreme of making it hard to create material that would fill every seat in a US theater. Or, pursue any source of income away from the stage of a comedy club. Barring an absolutely stunning statement of theological reversal, Hicks couldn&#8217;t have pursued TV (unless it was unsponsored, and aired on a network owned by an independent company).</p><p>If he&#8217;d lived, I think his decades of onstage sincerity and integrity would have finally paid off. Not because American audience are any more enlightened today. Oh, wow, my head spins just thinking about what he&#8217;d be saying about our &#8220;Hope And Change&#8221; President&#8217;s use of drone strikes!</p><p>This is an age when you can do almost as well with a small audience of people who absolutely love you as you can with a large audience of people who think you&#8217;re marginally less objectionable than whoever&#8217;s on the other channel. His access to his audience wouldn&#8217;t have been controlled by any large company (a network, a promoter, a record label). He could sell tickets, audio, and video directly to his fans. </p><p>And the power of social networks to spread something around to millions of people isn&#8217;t compatible with &#8220;bland and populist&#8221; material When was the last time someone Tweeted a link and said &#8220;Oh, wow, you HAVE to see what Leno said in his monologue last night!&#8221;?</p><p>Hicks seems like a reminder that you often have to keep the faith that a longterm equity investment will eventually pay off. All of the Hicks standup material we have is, alas, all of the material we&#8217;ll ever have. The point of view and the voice he had built after 15 years was amazing. And it was strong footing for whatever he would have built on top of it. </p><p>32 seems to be an age when many successful creative people get a little antsy and bored, and they start questioning what&#8217;s been working so far. They&#8217;ve built up a hell of a lot of knowledge and experience. What do they want to do with it? Often, they either try to use those same skills in different ways, or they try to augment what they have by developing a different set of skills.</p><p>When you listen to a few hours of Hicks&#8217; released standup, you come away (a) hoarse from laughter, (b) profoundly impressed, and (c) aware that there was some distance between Hicks and the audience. He feels a frustration with the world, and the people in those seats are part of the problem. </p><p>Richard Pryor, at the height of his powers, often found a way to quietly suggest &#8212; so subtly that you didn&#8217;t even think of it until long after &#8212; that you and he were there in the room to start working on a solution. Parts of his standup films are genuinely cathartic.</p><p>So I wonder what he would have built by age 50. The knowledge that you have an audience can drive you to narcissism. Or, it can drive you towards introspection. Here you have 1000 people who will be hanging on your every word for 70 minutes. What should you do with their attention? What would you like them to be thinking about the next morning?</p><p>It&#8217;s perfectly fine to send an audience away thinking nothing more substantive than &#8220;I definitely got $75 worth of entertainment for my $50 ticket.&#8221; One might even make a credible case that people pay $50 to attend a comedy show with a view towards laughing hard. I&#8217;m fascinated by Bill Hicks, but the fact that most of the other comedians I love &#8220;merely&#8221; entertain me shouldn&#8217;t be considered a mark against them.</p><p>And of course, dying young is the ultimate rose-colored filter. Every brave person becomes a colossus and every talented performer becomes a genius. All because of the feats they never had a chance to achieve, and the works they never had a chance to create. The bizarre dementia of a fan is that we keep expecting great things from the ones we worship, even long after they&#8217;ve died.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005L6BMNW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=B005L6BMNW&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;tag=andihnscelwas-20\">Preview &#8220;Artistic Roll Call&#8221; on the Amazon MP3 Store</a>.

(1) The album is filled with clever, funny songs; (2) but “White Wine In The Sun” is just a flat-out beautiful piece of music; and (3) as a bonus…it’s actually a Christmas song.</p><p>Add Tim to my growing list of “whiplash musicians.” I went from not having the slightest inkling that he existed, to hearing my first Tim Minchin song, to owning everything of his that was available in the Amazon MP3 Store, to being very sad that I then had to wait for him to release his next album just like every other Tim Minchin fan…all in the space of about an hour.</p><p>I absolutely freakin’ <em>love</em> Tim Minchin. My first Tim Minchin song was “Prejudice.” It’s catchy, and funny, and thus it’s exactly the sort of link you’d receive as an IM on a slow weekday mid-afternoon. Mr. Minchin was nice enough to post a video of the song to his YouTube channel, so I’ll just go ahead and embed it right here-ish:</p><p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/KVN_0qvuhhw?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span></p><p>That’s, like, nine pounds of clever in a five pound bag. I had gone my entire life without realizing that “Ginger” was an anagram of a highly offensive word. And now, it’s difficult for me to think of it as anything else. It serves as a valuable reminder that wordplay, like all active sports, often leads to careless injury. So if you’re going to let your son or daughter go out and spoonerize with other children, make sure they’re wearing protection.</p><p>(Aside: I had no idea until very recently that “ginger” is used as a derogatory term for redheads. Is that a European thing? [Edited: or an Australian thing?] It isn’t an American thing, right? We had red-headed kids in my school and yeah, I think many of them got teased. But only under the eternal rubric of “we’re 284 children plucked from our safe and familiar surroundings; we’re hoping that if we ruthlessly tease any kid who’s in any way different, maybe nobody will sense how terrified we all are.” </p><p>I never even heard of that use of “ginger” until a few years ago…and I had thought that my experiences with the Mean Kids faction of my junior high school had left me with an exhaustive database of derogatory insults. True, I didn’t have red hair. But I also had no developmental disabilities nor any desire to kiss boys, and the Mean Kids sure didn’t let <em>those</em> details stop them.</p><p>In a way, this fresh use of “Ginger” is reassuring. It’s additional evidence that butt-headed prejudice has no rhyme or reason. It’s just a kind of free-flailing tendril of idiocy that doesn’t really care what it latches onto. Now that I know I can’t do anything to personally eradicate prejudice on a worldwide scale, the pressure’s kind of off, isn’t it? End of aside.)</p><p>When you’re done laughing at “Prejudice,” switch off the part of your brain that understands English and listen to the song again, solely as a piece of music. That’s some powerful late-Seventies arena-style singer-songwriting, isn’t it? Most of Minchin’s songs remind me of one of Jeff Koons’ monumental-scale balloon animals. It’s a colorful item of obvious whimsy. But the thing’s twenty feet tall and it’s made out of stainless steel. The thing is structurally-sound, thanks to the impressive amount of engineering and fabrication work that went into its production.</p><p>“White Wine In The Sun” is a pretty, pretty song. It packs a punch, too. The best way to describe it is as “A Christmas song for nice people who happen to be atheists.”</p><p>I hope my atheist friends aren’t offended by that turn of phrase, which I’ve been in love with from the moment I first encountered it. I saw it in a post by an atheist, who used it to describe his default appraisal of religious folk: “Nice people who happen to believe in God.” It’s perfect. I think this basic form describes the vast majority of people.</p><p>First and foremost: “Nice People.” Regardless of what sort of jewelry we wear around our necks or what kind of bumper sticker we put on our cars, we know that we all agreed to at least <em>try</em> to be nice to each other, as one of the simple Terms And Conditions associated with the license for human DNA. If you’re upset about that, then you should have read the whole document before clicking the “I have read and agree to all of these terms” and then hitting “Install.”</p><p>Then comes the “…who happen to…” bit. However you choose to perceive the big picture of our reality, primarily you’d like to be define yourself as a Nice Person, instead of being perceived through the weird veil of a clumsy adjective. Further, there’s no need to describe atheism or religion in anything other than a neutral tone.</p><p>At its core, though, this construct underscores the premise that a nice person is a nice person because of who they are and how they treat people. Maybe their nature has been positively shaped by religion, maybe it’s been positively shaped by rational influences (again, going solely from a non-judgmental dictionary definition of “rational”). So long as they’re nice people, what does it matter?</p><p>The singer of “White Wine In The Sun” kicks the song off by saying “I really like Christmas.” Then he calmly states his objections to religious holidays. And although he makes several valid points against religion specifically, they’re gentle and subtle ones, and he’s only mentioning them in passing.</p><p>He saves his intense emotions for the main bit, where he explains why he treasures this holiday: he gets to spend time with his parents, his brothers and sisters, and his Gran, all together in the same place. He’s filled with gratitude for this regularly-scheduled day filled with warm feelings of love and support and family and belonging.</p><p>What a marvelous sense of perspective. An airliner pumps tons of greenhouse gases into the air as it crisscrosses the country. But it brings you home. On that basis, you can only be grateful that it exists.</p><p>“White Wine In The Sun” is a live recording and the song cast an obvious spell on the audience. The audience had heard a dozen funny songs before this one. During the beginning of “White Wine,” they chuckled at all of the right parts. Those who had never heard the song before, however, seemed to grow a bit uneasy; the funny bits were more like clever observations than actual jokes. And soon, the funny bits disappeared entirely. You can almost hear the thoughts going through their heads: “Is Tim…being sincere? Is he trying to make me feel a genuine, cathartic emotion? Hey, where’s that crying sound coming from? Crap! It’s <em>me!</em>”</p><p>Sure, I’ll admit it: I was powerfully moved when I reached the core of the song, and he started singing about his family. I’m very sad to say that I’ve shared my last Christmas ever with some of the people on that list of “Dad and brothers and sisters and Gram and Mom.” I still miss those people a lot, even years after losing them.</p><p>Just when I was thinking “I can’t believe I got through that without crying,” he started singing about his daughter. And that, dear readers, was when I was very, very glad that I was alone in the room.</p><p>I absolutely freakin’ <em>love</em> Tim Minchin.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005L6BMNW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B005L6BMNW&linkCode=as2&tag=andihnscelwas-20\" target=\"_blank\">Sample “White Wine In The Sun” on the Amazon MP3 store</a>.

But only under the eternal rubric of &#8220;we&#8217;re 284 children plucked from our safe and familiar surroundings; we&#8217;re hoping that if we ruthlessly tease any kid who&#8217;s in any way different, maybe nobody will sense how terrified we all are.&#8221; </p><p>I never even heard of that use of &#8220;ginger&#8221; until a few years ago&#8230;and I had thought that my experiences with the Mean Kids faction of my junior high school had left me with an exhaustive database of derogatory insults. True, I didn&#8217;t have red hair. But I also had no developmental disabilities nor any desire to kiss boys, and the Mean Kids sure didn&#8217;t let <em>those</em> details stop them.</p><p>In a way, this fresh use of &#8220;Ginger&#8221; is reassuring. It&#8217;s additional evidence that butt-headed prejudice has no rhyme or reason. It&#8217;s just a kind of free-flailing tendril of idiocy that doesn&#8217;t really care what it latches onto. Now that I know I can&#8217;t do anything to personally eradicate prejudice on a worldwide scale, the pressure&#8217;s kind of off, isn&#8217;t it? End of aside.)</p><p>When you&#8217;re done laughing at &#8220;Prejudice,&#8221; switch off the part of your brain that understands English and listen to the song again, solely as a piece of music. That&#8217;s some powerful late-Seventies arena-style singer-songwriting, isn&#8217;t it? Most of Minchin&#8217;s songs remind me of one of Jeff Koons&#8217; monumental-scale balloon animals. It&#8217;s a colorful item of obvious whimsy. But the thing&#8217;s twenty feet tall and it&#8217;s made out of stainless steel. The thing is structurally-sound, thanks to the impressive amount of engineering and fabrication work that went into its production.</p><p>&#8220;White Wine In The Sun&#8221; is a pretty, pretty song. It packs a punch, too. The best way to describe it is as &#8220;A Christmas song for nice people who happen to be atheists.&#8221;</p><p>I hope my atheist friends aren&#8217;t offended by that turn of phrase, which I&#8217;ve been in love with from the moment I first encountered it. I saw it in a post by an atheist, who used it to describe his default appraisal of religious folk: &#8220;Nice people who happen to believe in God.&#8221; It&#8217;s perfect. I think this basic form describes the vast majority of people.</p><p>First and foremost: &#8220;Nice People.&#8221; Regardless of what sort of jewelry we wear around our necks or what kind of bumper sticker we put on our cars, we know that we all agreed to at least <em>try</em> to be nice to each other, as one of the simple Terms And Conditions associated with the license for human DNA. If you&#8217;re upset about that, then you should have read the whole document before clicking the &#8220;I have read and agree to all of these terms&#8221; and then hitting &#8220;Install.&#8221;</p><p>Then comes the &#8220;&#8230;who happen to&#8230;&#8221; bit. However you choose to perceive the big picture of our reality, primarily you&#8217;d like to be define yourself as a Nice Person, instead of being perceived through the weird veil of a clumsy adjective. Further, there&#8217;s no need to describe atheism or religion in anything other than a neutral tone.</p><p>At its core, though, this construct underscores the premise that a nice person is a nice person because of who they are and how they treat people. Maybe their nature has been positively shaped by religion, maybe it&#8217;s been positively shaped by rational influences (again, going solely from a non-judgmental dictionary definition of &#8220;rational&#8221;). So long as they&#8217;re nice people, what does it matter?</p><p>The singer of &#8220;White Wine In The Sun&#8221; kicks the song off by saying &#8220;I really like Christmas.&#8221; Then he calmly states his objections to religious holidays. And although he makes several valid points against religion specifically, they&#8217;re gentle and subtle ones, and he&#8217;s only mentioning them in passing.</p><p>He saves his intense emotions for the main bit, where he explains why he treasures this holiday: he gets to spend time with his parents, his brothers and sisters, and his Gran, all together in the same place. He&#8217;s filled with gratitude for this regularly-scheduled day filled with warm feelings of love and support and family and belonging.</p><p>What a marvelous sense of perspective. An airliner pumps tons of greenhouse gases into the air as it crisscrosses the country. But it brings you home. On that basis, you can only be grateful that it exists.</p><p>&#8220;White Wine In The Sun&#8221; is a live recording and the song cast an obvious spell on the audience. The audience had heard a dozen funny songs before this one. During the beginning of &#8220;White Wine,&#8221; they chuckled at all of the right parts. Those who had never heard the song before, however, seemed to grow a bit uneasy; the funny bits were more like clever observations than actual jokes. And soon, the funny bits disappeared entirely. You can almost hear the thoughts going through their heads: &#8220;Is Tim&#8230;being sincere? Is he trying to make me feel a genuine, cathartic emotion? Hey, where&#8217;s that crying sound coming from? Crap! It&#8217;s <em>me!</em>&#8221;</p><p>Sure, I&#8217;ll admit it: I was powerfully moved when I reached the core of the song, and he started singing about his family. I&#8217;m very sad to say that I&#8217;ve shared my last Christmas ever with some of the people on that list of &#8220;Dad and brothers and sisters and Gram and Mom.&#8221; I still miss those people a lot, even years after losing them.</p><p>Just when I was thinking &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe I got through that without crying,&#8221; he started singing about his daughter. And that, dear readers, was when I was very, very glad that I was alone in the room.</p><p>I absolutely freakin&#8217; <em>love</em> Tim Minchin.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005L6BMNW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=B005L6BMNW&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;tag=andihnscelwas-20\" target=\"_blank\">Sample &#8220;White Wine In The Sun&#8221; on the Amazon MP3 store</a>.
