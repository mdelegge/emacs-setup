The pull-up bar I purchased came with handles that I wanted to adapt for other exercises (like &#8220;Let Me Ins&#8221; around a post, or &#8220;Towel Curls&#8221;). I didn&#8217;t trust my knot-tying ability, and all the rope rated to my weight was bulky. I knew nylon webbing was very strong and so was looking for solidly sewn loops of nylon webbing that could hold my weight.</p><p>Thus I came across nylon runners (or &#8220;slings&#8221;) meant for climbing. These are a loop of nylon webbing with a sturdy dogbone stitch. They are made to support even a falling climber and their gear. They come in a number of sizes (and colors). I use the 30cm runners to loop through my handle ends, then a climbing carabiner to connect these to either the 60cm runner for some exercises (Let Me Ins) and the 120cm runner for other exercises (Towel Curls). I have also successfully hung my pull-up bar from existing holes in the main floor joists in my basement, precluding the adaptation/installation of the provided mounting hardware. Recently, I used two of the 30 cm runners to loop onto my motorcycle front fork to connect to ratcheting tie downs in order to hold the bike upright for beginning of season maintenance (oil change, etc.). </p><p>In addition to my uses, other reviews of this product have pointed out a number of great uses for these runners: they can be used in all kinds of load-bearing/load-redirecting uses. One example is to provide a soft-but-strong attachment point for tie downs to a motorcycle or other cargo for transportation. This is a truly versatile, simple, and cool tool. </p><p>--  Mike Braden</p><p>Black Diamond  Nylon Runners<br />

We had some questions and problems with it:</p><ul><li>How high do I have to hang the bulb? The answer is &#8220;low enough to keep them warm.&#8221; That height changes every few days to a week. Companies sell tripod like devices to hold these lights.</li><li>How long do I need to use the light? Until the chicks no longer need it. Again something you have to learn from observation and watching a thermometer.</li><li>We were raising our chicks in a cardboard box in the house. The light (which was on 24/7) was annoying. The heat was even worse. Plus we have two young children so we had to watch them to ensure they did not burn themselves.</li></ul><p>The EcoGlow Brooder solved all of these issues. You set the height to allow the chicks to fit under it comfortably. As they get taller you just remove the legs and then move it up a notch and reattach them. Easy and obvious. When the chicks stop hanging out under the brooder they no longer need it. Again, simple and obvious. There is no garish light and it is impossible for the kids to hurt themselves since the device is cool to the touch everywhere but the area where the chicks are. It also uses less power than the typical 150-Watt bulb based brooder.</p><p>When it came time to store the device I first cleaned it and popped off the legs. Then I stuck it in a box on the shelf with the rest of our supplies where it quietly awaits the next batch of chicks. No need to worry about broken bulbs.</p><p>Yes, there are negatives, but they are minor. As the chicks age you have to clean the device. They will eventually perch on it and will do what chickens do. No big deal &#8212; you just unplug it and wipe it down with a bleach wipe. Despite the word &#8220;Glow&#8221; in the name this device does not emit light so you will likely need some form of light unless you have a window handy. But any old light will do and it only needs to be on a few hours a day. It can be a little hard to see the chicks huddled under the brooder but we never found it to be an issue.</p><p>Like other Brinsea products this one is a little expensive. We feel it paid for itself in convenience and long term usefulness.  </p><p>-- Sean Perry</p><p>Brinsea EcoGlow 20 Chick Brooder<br />

However, the information is often from sensors far from our location. I want data from my backyard with the convenience of not having to go outside to read it. I have been using the wireless Indoor/Outdoor Humidex Thermometer for over two years. It is perfect for my needs. I have placed it in a central location in the house and I take a glance at the readings every time I pass it (at least ten times a day).</p><p>Setting it up is a snap. First insert two AA batteries into the back of the monitor and two more into the remote outside sensor. Press the reset button on both and you should begin receiving data which is displayed on the monitor. Look for a suitable place to locate the sensor. A shady area is recommended for accurate readings. The maximum transmission range is 45 meters but that is in open spaces. Walls will cut down on the separation distance. A signal detector icon indicates how strong the connection is between the two devices. Using this will help you find the best place to put each of the two gadgets. The remote sensor is splash proof but it should not be exposed to heavy rain. I have put mine under the eaves of my garage. The monitor can be mounted on a wall or placed on any flat surface.</p><p>This particular model is perfectly suited for cold Canadian weather. The remote temperature sensor is good for -50°C to 70°C (-58°F to 158°F). The main difference between this monitor and the competition is that this model provides decimal temperature readings, which is a rarity. A temperature of 16.6°C to 17.4°C would register as 17°C on most monitors. I appreciate this precision because I am sure I can tell the difference between these two readings. On the monitor there is a battery indicator icon, letting you know when the power is starting to go. The batteries should last about 12 months.</p><p>Besides the indoor/outdoor temperatures, the monitor also displays the outside humidity and a &#8220;Humidex&#8221; index to indicate how comfortable/uncomfortable the temperature really is outside.</p><p>-- Marcel Dufresne</p><p>Thermor Bios Indoor/Outdoor Humidex Thermometer<br />

I previously used DEET (a  known carcinogen), skin-so-soft, dryer sheets, candles, coils, noise generators and other repellents but threw them all away when this showed up. It gives you a 15 foot &#8220;bubble&#8221; of protection using a butane cartridge to heat a pad of repellent. Riding in the boat does tend to blow out the pilot light in the device but a few clicks of the starter and it&#8217;s going again.

He talked about some crazy wallet made out of a material called Cuben.</p><p>Now this sounded promising. I headed off to Google and searched for “william gibson wallet.” The top result took me to a <a href=\"http://www.unfinishedman.com/yasutomo-wa-ben-wallet-review-the-william-gibson-wallet/\">review of the Yasutomo Wa-Ben wallet</a> at <a href=\"http://www.unfinishedman.com/\">unfinishedman.com</a>.</p><p>Chad’s review convinced me that the Yasutomo 2020 Wa-Ben wallet, made in Hong Kong by Jason Hung and touted as the world’s first Cuben Fiber wallet (specifically, Cuben Fiber CT9K.5), could be exactly what I was looking for.</p><p>So I slapped down an electronic $49.50 (post-paid from Hong Kong), and three weeks later I signed for my new wallet at the post office (it seems the people in charge of these decisions deem packages from Hong Kong as untrustworthy).</p><p>After carrying it around daily for about a week, I can say it was exactly what I was looking for.</p><p>The wallet is extremely light (0.69 ounces, according to the website), extremely thin (you can see through it!), and extremely durable. I often forget I’m even carrying it and have to frantically check my front pocket to see if it’s there. It always is.</p><p>It has six credit card pockets, two “hidden” pockets behind the card pockets, and two cash/note pockets, so there’s plenty of room to carry more than enough.</p><p>So here’s my short review. The Yasutomo 2020 Wa-Ben wallet is fabulous piece of gear, and I recommend it highly for anyone looking to lighten their everyday carry load.</p><p>-- <a href=\"http://fordsbasement.com/\">Tom Fassbender</a></p><p>Yasutomo 2020 Wa-Ben Wallet<br />

Youngsters will learn the joy of buying and using their own tools, setting up their own workshop, and building any one of seven wonderful houses. More than 100 black-and-white photographs and 150 illustrations and diagrams teach children and parents how to set up a workshop, get started using basic carpentry tools, and finally building their very own wood-frame house, factory-built house, glass house, post-and-beam house, junkyard house, tree house, and now an A-frame house.&#8221;</p><p>We’ll pick our favorite review (about any tool you love) and notify the author.
