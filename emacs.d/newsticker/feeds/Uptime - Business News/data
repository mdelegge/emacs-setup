The <em>Washington Post</em>'s <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-innovations/code-for-america-an-elegant-solution-for-government-it-problems/2011/12/16/gIQAXrIu2O_story.html/\">description</a> captured what everyone was already thinking: CFA is the “technology world’s equivalent of the Peace Corps or Teach for America.”</p><p>It's an apt comparison. All three organizations choose a specific municipal problem and recruit volunteers with specific skillsets—in this case, people able to conceptualize and build some sort of tech tool—to tackle it. Accordingly, the past two years of the CFA program have produced a few high profile successes: \"<a href=\"http://codeforamerica.org/?cfa_project=blightstatus\">BlightStatus</a>\" in New Orleans lets people check up on blight in their neighborhoods, while \"<a href=\"http://codeforamerica.org/?cfa_project=honolulu-answers\">Honolulu Answers</a>\" in Hawaii refined search on the municipality's websites. In Boston, the CFA was responsible for both \"<a href=\"http://codeforamerica.org/?cfa_project=wheres-my-school-bus\">Where's My School Bus?</a>\", which provides real-time school bus information for parents, and \"<a href=\"http://codeforamerica.org/?cfa_project=adopt-a-hydrant\">Adopt-A-Hydrant</a>,\" which helps the city save money by letting people volunteer to shovel hydrants near their homes out of the snow in the winter.</p><p>Any city can apply to host CFA fellows. If successful, the paid fellows spend a month in the chosen cities, then head back to CFA’s headquarters in San Francisco to regroup, code, and work on their projects. The third crop of CFA fellows will disperse all across the country in 2013 to Louisville, Kentucky; Kansas City, Kansas; Kansas City, Missouri; Las Vegas, Nevada; New York City, New York; South Bend, Indiana; San Mateo County, California; San Francisco, California; Summit County, Ohio; and Oakland, California.</p></div><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/business/2013/03/urban-activists-hack-their-way-towards-open-government/#p3n\">Read 56 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/business/2013/03/urban-activists-hack-their-way-towards-open-government/?comments=1\">Comments</a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/business/~4/9Z2rBjRGm2U\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://arstechnica.com/business/2013/03/urban-activists-hack-their-way-towards-open-government/feed/") (slash:comments nil "0") (feedburner:origLink nil "http://arstechnica.com/business/2013/03/urban-activists-hack-their-way-towards-open-government/")) (item nil (title nil "What remains of an irradiated, damaged, and abandoned Japanese town") (link nil "http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~r/arstechnica/business/~3/9pd2rsa-gKs/") (comments nil "http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/03/what-remains-of-an-irradiated-damaged-and-abandoned-japanese-town/#comments") (pubDate nil "Fri, 29 Mar 2013 21:50:36 +0000") (dc:creator nil "Casey Johnston") (category nil "Ministry of Innovation") (category nil "Scientific Method") (category nil "Fukushima") (category nil "gallery") (category nil "google") (category nil "google maps") (category nil "Japan") (category nil "namie") (category nil "nuclear accident") (category nil "nuclear power") (guid ((isPermaLink .

Already <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/business/2013/02/dell-faces-goal-line-stand-by-angry-investors-in-bid-to-go-private/\">facing a backlash from Dell's biggest stockholders</a> over the terms of the bid that he and private equity firm Silver Lake have made for the company, there are now two rival bids to contend with. The first comes from a group led by infamous corporate raider Carl Icahn with another led by asset management company Blackstone Group. And both, at least on the surface, appear to be better deals for Dell shareholders—-especially those who want to bet long on the company and keep their stake.</p><p>In a <a href=\"http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20130325005524/en/Dell-Special-Committee-Receives-Alternative-Acquisition-Proposals\">press release issued this morning</a>, the \"special committee\" formed by Dell Inc.'s board to handle negotiations for the company's sale acknowledged the offers from the Blackstone and Icahn groups. \"Both proposals could reasonably be expected to result in superior proposals\" to the Michael Dell/Silver Lake offer, the committee said in its written statement on the offers. The committee will now enter into further negotiations with both to hash out the details of each offer and weigh them against the plan to go private.</p><p>Both the Blackstone Group's offer and that of Ichan's group aim to keep Dell public while offering shareholders who wish to cash out the opportunity to get a bigger payday than under the Dell/Silver Lake plan. The Blackstone group is offering \"greater than $14.25 in cash per share\" for those stockholders who take the deal, while those who wish to stay investors in the company would be able to swap their shares for ones in the \"merged\" company, subject to a capped number of shares, valued at the same amount as the cash payout. The Icahn offer would pay out $15 per share or a one-for-one stock swap and pay the \"breakup\" fee for terminating the offer from Michael Dell and Silver Lake. The Dell/Silver Lake offer proposed paying shareholders $13.65 per share.</p></div><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/business/2013/03/dells-game-of-thrones-icahn-blackstone-make-rival-bids-for-company/#p3n\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/business/2013/03/dells-game-of-thrones-icahn-blackstone-make-rival-bids-for-company/?comments=1\">Comments</a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/business/~4/ucLNqlOMUOQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://arstechnica.com/business/2013/03/dells-game-of-thrones-icahn-blackstone-make-rival-bids-for-company/feed/") (slash:comments nil "0") (feedburner:origLink nil "http://arstechnica.com/business/2013/03/dells-game-of-thrones-icahn-blackstone-make-rival-bids-for-company/")) (item nil (title nil "Hong Kong goes underground for new data center caves") (link nil "http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~r/arstechnica/business/~3/ncdBsEpzmKo/") (comments nil "http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/03/hong-kong-looks-underground-for-new-data-center-caves/#comments") (pubDate nil "Sun, 24 Mar 2013 19:00:17 +0000") (dc:creator nil "WIRED UK") (category nil "Ministry of Innovation") (category nil "Technology Lab") (category nil "data centers") (category nil "Hong Kong") (guid ((isPermaLink .
