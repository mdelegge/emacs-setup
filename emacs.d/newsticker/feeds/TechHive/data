<article><section class=\"page\"><p>
After coming under fire in recent weeks for allowing <a href=\"http://www.techhive.com/article/2040267/facebook-pledges-more-action-to-combat-hate-speech.html\">anti-woman sentiment</a> to flourish on the site, Facebook is now facing the heat from a group of breast cancer survivors accusing the social networking site of removing content that could help women.
</p><p>
Photographer David Jay has been working on a series of portraits of breast cancer survivors called <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-SCAR-Project/255064983743\">The Scar Project</a> for the last seven years, and has posted his images in Facebook for the last five. Facebook has deleted some of Jay’s photos in the past and suspended his account for 30 days for violating the site’s nudity policy. But Jay decided to use <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/14/opinion/my-medical-choice.html\">actress Angelina Jolie’s recent mastectomy story</a> to highlight The Scar Project, reposting dozens of old portraits. Some of those photos were deleted within days, and Jay was again suspended.

One of Jay’s readers, a breast cancer warrior named Scorchy Barrington, recently started a <a href=\"https://www.change.org/facebooksurvivors\">Change.org petition</a> asking Facebook to rethink its policy on photos of women showing their mastectomy scars. More than 8000 supporters backed Barrington’s petition.

<article><section class=\"page\"><p>
On Tuesday, at the opening of a new exhibition at the Time Warner Medialab in New York, DC Entertainment’s President, Diane Nelson, and Co-Publisher, Jim Lee announced a new storytelling technology that would soon start appearing in DC’s digital comics line.
</p><p>
It’s a concept that Friedrich Nietzsche would have appreciated, had he been into <em>Batman</em>. Because: when you read a digital comic book from the new DC2 Multiverse line… the comic book also reads <em>you.</em></p><p>
A “Multiverse” comic (which can be read online or offline through mobile apps and Web apps) is a technological mashup. It contains features from conventional comic books, multipath video games such as DC’s successful <em>Batman: Arkham</em> series, and the old-fashioned “choose your own adventure” books that are familiar to any veteran of family road trips. Each chapter of a Multiverse title contains several breakpoints which prompt the reader to select one character, weapon, or action from several options. Each decision unlocks new content, and sends the reader down a different direction for the story.
</p><aside class=\"pullquote\"><q>\"At the end of the day, two different readers can experience two different storylines and two different conclusions,\" said DC's Jim Lee.</q></aside><p>
Here’s the twist: the comic is also sending data back to DC Entertainment. If readers show more interest in Alfred Pennyworth than The Penguin, the comic’s creators and editors will ultimately learn about that.

Like every good video game, you’re awarded a score at the end of every mission.
</p><p>Guards patrol the facilities you’ll be burglarizing and shoot on sight, so you’ll need to dispatch them or give them the slip. There’s always the direct approach, which involves barreling into them with your impressive jumping ability and pummeling them to death. I prefer to be subtle: connect a light switch to a power outlet and electrocute them as they walk past, or remotely call an elevator to their floor, slinking by while they’re investigating the noise.

One of the computer scientists who turned on the Internet in 1983, <a href=\"http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/297508/The_Grill_Google_s_Internet_Evangelist_Vint_Cerf_on_the_Hot_Seat\">Vinton Cerf</a>, is concerned that much of the data created since then, and for years still to come, will be lost to time.
</p><p>
Cerf warned that digital things created today—spreadsheets, documents, presentations, as well as mountains of scientific data—won’t be readable in the years and centuries ahead.
</p><p>
Cerf illustrated the problem in a simple way. He runs Microsoft Office 2011 on Macintosh, but it cannot read a 1997 PowerPoint file. “It doesn’t know what it is,” he said.
</p><p>
“I’m not blaming Microsoft,” said Cerf, who is Google’s vice president and chief Internet evangelist. “What I’m saying is that backward compatibility is very hard to preserve over very long periods of time.”

After months of delays and redesigns, the Wikipad Android gaming tablet will launch June 11 for $249.
</p><p><a href=\"http://www.wikipad.com/\">Wikipad</a> is a 7-inch Android tablet that slides into a U-shaped game controller. The controller is included with the tablet, and packs dual analog sticks, a directional pad, four face buttons, bumper buttons, and triggers. In other words, it’s set up like a standard console game controller, except it also has its own speakers.

Specs on the tablet itself are similar to Google’s Nexus 7: an Nvidia Tegra 3 processor, a display with a resolution of 1280 by 800 pixels, 1GB of RAM, 16GB of storage, and a 2-megapixel front-facing camera.
</p><p>
The Wikipad’s main advantages are a microSD card slot and micro-HDMI output. The tablet alone weighs 0.71 pounds and measures 0.42 inches thick, but the controller bulks the package up to a weight of 1.23 pounds and thickness of 2.57 inches.

Scientists say that prolonged sitting is bad for your health. So I try not to. Instead of sitting down at my desk each day for work, I stand at it. And, in fact, I walk. As I’ve <a href=\"http://www.macworld.com/article/1156988/treadmilldesk.html\">written</a><a href=\"http://www.techhive.com/article/2027963/review-lifespans-bluetooth-enabled-treadmill-desk-is-flawed-but-functional.html\">previously</a>, I walk while I work, at 2.5 miles per hour. I’m walking right now as I write these words.
</p><p>
Though my first standing desk was really a normal desk with cardboard boxes stacked atop it, I now use legitimate standing-height desks instead. But while I tread all day long, many standing desk users prefer to take occasional seated breaks. That’s where height-adjustable desks come in. I recently spent a couple months experimenting with a <a href=\"https://myupdesk.com/updesk/mahogany-small\">Mahogany UpDesk</a>, from a company also called UpDesk.

UpDesk sells a variety of adjustable desks, both mechanical (CrankUps) and electric (PowerUps). The Mahogany desk I reviewed was an electric one, the medium model: 60 inches wide by 30 inches deep. It can go as low as 26.5 inches tall, and as high as 42.5 inches tall.
</p><p>
That peak height, 42.5 inches, is a smidgen low for my needs. I’m 6’2”, standing atop a treadmill that adds several more inches. If you purchase the optional <a href=\"https://myupdesk.com/store/product/wheel-set-DKWS\">$59 wheel set</a> for the desk, that adds another three inches of height to the setup.

Nvidia’s CEO showed an updated version of the company’s Shield portable gaming device at the Computex trade show Tuesday, and said it will start shipping the device later this month to customers who pre-ordered it.
</p><p>
It has the same basic design as the system <a href=\"http://www.pcworld.com/article/2023841/nvidia-plans-a-tegra-4-based-portable-gaming-device.html\">unveiled</a> at the International CES in January, with its 5-inch flip-out display, but Nvidia has worked on the controls and materials to make the device feel more solid, said CEO Jen-Hsun Huang.

“The basic architecture is the same. Some of the industrial design was enhanced, it feels more solid. You can really fight it, it feels very rigid,” he said.

<article><section class=\"page\"><p>
Nvidia is usually trumpeting the graphics performance of its Tegra 4 chip, but at the Computex trade show on Tuesday CEO Jen-Hsun Huang showed how its newest processor can be used to create a precise, affordable stylus for tablets.
</p><p>
Nvidia is using the image processing technology in the Tegra 4, combined with its <a href=\"http://www.nvidia.com/content/PDF/tegra_white_papers/direct-touch-whitepaper.pdf\">DirectTouch</a> display technology, to allow an ordinary mechanical stylus to do work that normally requires a digital one.
</p><p>
Huang showed the technology to a small group of reporters at Computex. Working on a small prototype Android tablet, he was able to apply various levels of pressure to create thick or thin lines on the screen—calligraphy, as he called it. Normally he would have to touch menu buttons on the side of the display to change the thickness of the brush. Flipping the stylus over allowed it to be used as an eraser.
</p><p>
\"We're using image processing technology to reduce the cost of a stylus, from $20 for a digital stylus to zero for a mechanical stylus,\" he said. The stylus can be made from any capacitive material, Huang said.

It can be awkward to try and convince a friend that they shouldn’t be driving, but it’s a situation that many of us find ourselves in: It’s late on a Friday night, you’ve been out with coworkers for a few hours, and then Steve from accounting unevenly rises and declares it’s time for him to head home. “Are you okay to drive?” someone asks, and he says he’s fine—but it also took him several minutes to find his keys in his jacket pocket. Maybe he’s just tired, maybe he’s past his limit, but there’s no real way for you to determine whether or not you should insist on calling him a cab.

A group of award winning technologists and industrial designers at 2045Tech have developed an appcessory prototype for a highly accurate smartphone breathalyzer called <a href=\"http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/floome-the-most-accurate-smartphone-breathalyzer\">Floome</a> (funding through June 8). A pocket-sized device with a companion app, the Floome is designed to be easy to carry and never needs charging. The streamlined Floome plugs directly into the headphone jack on any iOS, Android, or Windows Phone device. From there, the user blows into the Floome’s removable, cleanable mouthpiece and the device then uses fuel cell sensors (like the ones found in professional breathalyzers) to detect ethanol molecules.

So far, 2013 has been a real banner year for virtual reality enthusiasts. Oculus is almost done shipping the last of its <a href=\"http://www.techhive.com/article/260241/oculus_rift_might_finally_get_virtual_reality_right.html\">Rift virtual reality headsets</a> to Kickstarter backers. And Virtuix Tuesday launched its own Kickstarter project  to fund manufacturing of its upcoming <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1944625487/omni-move-naturally-in-your-favorite-game\">Omni treadmill</a> (funding through July 22, shown above in an artist's rendition).
</p><p>
Unlike a traditional treadmill, which forces you to walk a specific path, Virtuix’s product is the latest in a series of upcoming “omnidirectional” treadmills for gamers.
</p><div class=\"embed-wrapper\"><iframe src=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1944625487/omni-move-naturally-in-your-favorite-game/widget/video.html\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></div><h2>Omni details</h2><p>
The base of the Omni looks like a satellite dish, with grooves at regular intervals around the platform. The user is constrained by a waist-high ring in the center of the device, designed for both safety and support, but is free to turn in any direction and begin walking.
</p><p>
Specially designed shoes with small nubs on the bottom keep the player from sliding from side to side. If you’re concerned that you don’t have space for this contraption, (say, if you live in a tiny apartment), Virtuix promises the device will pack up smaller for storage.

Having recently been through the particular brand of torture that is apartment hunting in San Francisco, I was so very relieved to discover that other, smarter options exist beyond that tired old go-to, Craigslist. I will always love Craigslist for everything it has done for me, and the addition of a map view and photos in the search results list has only made the site even more useful. But I could do without all the gray hairs that incessant searches and countless lists of semi-complete listings have earned me.
</p><p>
The next time I uproot myself, I will turn to one (or more) of these handy apps built to aid the savvy apartment hunter. I can see it now: I'm strolling though my ideal neighborhood, looking at map of nearby listings, tapping to view photos of apartments in the area that fit my needs, emailing the landlord right there and then from the sidewalk, and viewing the perfect property a few minutes later. Highly rated apps like the ones below can make that experience possible. Now, if only there was an app to simplify the application process…
</p><h2>HotPads — <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hotpads.mobile&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwyLDEsImNvbS5ob3RwYWRzLm1vYmlsZSJd\" target=\"_blank\">Android</a>, <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hotpads-rentals-real-estate/id345957475?mt=8\" target=\"_blank\">iOS</a></h2><figure class=\"left original\"><img src=\"http://images.techhive.com/images/article/2013/05/hotpads_android1-100037453-orig.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\" \" width=\"288\" height=\"512\"/><figcaption/></figure><p>
It's more than a clever name that makes <a href=\"http://hotpads.com/\" target=\"_blank\">HotPads</a> worth a look. It gives you a lot of control over your search terms and quickly shows you all the listings within your parameters on an easy-to-read map. You can enter a city or zip code or use your current GPS location, then enter your desired price range, number of bedrooms, and keywords. You can further narrow your search results by entering other factors such as whether dogs or cats are permitted, number of photos in the listing, and property type.
</p><p>
When you tap ‘search’, you’ll see each available listing clearly indicated on a map. When you click on a listing, you can see photos, pricing, a description of the listing, when it was last updated, and whether any other units are available in the building. From the same screen, you can tap to call, email the listing, or enter your information and send an inquiry about availability. You can also add the listing to your favorites for easy access the next time you open the app.

Intel recently introduced the world to its <a href=\"http://www.pcworld.com/article/2040495/intel-releases-faster-more-efficient-core-cpus-in-renewed-bid-for-mobile-market.html\"> powerful and efficient Haswell line </a> of fourth-generation Core processors. While <a href=\"http://www.pcworld.com/article/2040500/intel-s-new-desktop-cpu-lineup-benchmark-results-reveal-little-competition-for-4th-gen-core.html\">our lab found</a> that Haswell is only five to 10 percent faster than Intel's previous generation CPU, the all-new microarchitecture crushes AMD's best consumer CPU in every test except graphics performance. Haswell processors will begin making its way to consumers over the next few months including a bevy of new toys from Acer hitting markets this month.
</p><p>
The new line of beefy digital guts are aimed directly at consumers who are still in the market for the formidable computing functionality that a pocket-sized phone can’t (yet) handle—those for whom “the post-PC world” is still more theoretical than fact.
</p><p>
Acer, for their part, appears to be latching on to this next-gen Haswell tech as a means to maintaining consumer interest in its line of PCs. The Taiwan-based manufacturer announced that they will include no less than 23 Haswell-fitted Aspire-brand notebooks that range anywhere between $600 to $1700 and six Aspire-brand desktops ranging anywhere between $700 and $1500.
</p><h2>Some new toys coming our way</h2><figure class=\" large\"><a href=\"http://images.techhive.com/images/article/2013/06/acer-aspire-v7-482pg-100040176-orig.jpg\" class=\"zoom\"><img src=\"http://images.techhive.com/images/article/2013/06/acer-aspire-v7-482pg-100040176-large.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\" \" width=\"580\" height=\"444\"/></a><figcaption>The Acer V7-482 Ultrabook</figcaption></figure><p>

While the V7 was announced in early May, this is a whole new configuration featuring a new processor. This particular V7 will be an exclusive through Acer.com and retail for $1300.

Eye-Fi’s new <a href=\"http://www.eye.fi/products/mobi\">Mobi wireless SD card</a> promises to make the business of wirelessly transferring photos faster, easier, and cheaper. While no longer a revolutionary concept, transferring via Wi-Fi and its attendant setup  still can be a glitchy proposition for cameras without networking capabilities built-in. Eye-Fi has now taken this technology one zero configuration step further. The Eye-Fi Mobi lets you connect directly to your smartphone or tablet, providing instant sharing opportunities as well as backup protection for your pictures.

While some shooters are content with smartphone images, others seek to reduce the hassle factor of using their higher quality camera to share images on the go. The Mobi bypasses the computer and the cloud by transferring all the action to a free Eye-Fi app for iOS, Android, or Kindle Fire. Just enter the card’s unique 10-digit code to pair the card with one or more devices—no other setup is required. Once done, you can transfer high-resolution photos and videos to your device’s camera roll or gallery and send them on their way to friends and family or save them for editing.

Toshiba on Monday took the wraps off what it hopes will be the first tablet powered by <a href=\"http://www.techhive.com/article/2031261/nvidia-unveils-new-tegra-chips-for-smartphones-tablets.html\">Nvidia's latest Tegra 4 processor</a>. Dubbed the Excite Pro, this $500 tablet runs Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean and has a 10.1-inch 2560 x 1600 pixel IPS display. For those of you counting pixels at home, that puts the Excite Pro at 300 pixels per inch (ppi)—more than what's currently offered on <a href=\"http://www.techhive.com/article/2013582/review-fourth-generation-ipad-is-faster-stronger-better.html\">Apple's iPad with Retina display</a> and its 264 pixels per inch.

The tablet also features an 8-megapixel camera which, when combined with the Pro's beefy processor, allows you to shoot in both panorama and high-dynamic range (HDR) modes. Toshiba also claims that the Pro will feature enhanced image stabilization, though I'm not exactly sure we should be encouraging people to take photos using tablets.
</p><p>
Toshiba also unveiled two other Excite tablets on Monday that it hopes will grab people's attention: The Excite Write and Excite Pure. The Write is outfitted with a digitizer display and features a stylus that supports 1024 pressure points for more accurate handwriting recognition. The tablet looks like it'll come in handy when taking notes or drawing. It'll be interesting to see how it compares next to <a href=\"http://www.pcworld.com/article/260902/samsung_galaxy_note_10_1_review_the_pen_sets_this_android_tablet_apart.html\">Samsung's 10-inch Galaxy Note</a>. The Write will retail for $100 more than the Excite Pro but—save for the digitizer and stylus—the two tabs are identical in terms of specs.
</p><figure class=\"left medium\"><a href=\"http://images.techhive.com/images/article/2013/06/excitepure_at15-a16_at15-a16a_angle3-100040252-large.jpg\" class=\"zoom\"><img src=\"http://images.techhive.com/images/article/2013/06/excitepure_at15-a16_at15-a16a_angle3-100040252-medium.jpg\" height=\"269\" width=\"300\" align=\"left\" alt=\" \"/></a><figcaption>Toshiba Excite Pure</figcaption></figure><p>
If you aren't keen on styluses, or are just on a budget, then the Excite Pure may be more your speed. This 10.1-inch tablet is powered by last year's NVIDIA Tegra 3 processor and 1GB of RAM (as opposed to the 2GB found in the Pro and Write). The tablet runs Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean, like its older siblings, and also features a Micro SD card slot that allows you to augment the device's 16GB of internal storage. So what’s the benefit of getting a tablet with slightly lower specs? A greatly lower price-tag: The Excite Pure will cost $300, putting it in the same price-range as the <a href=\"http://www.techhive.com/product/1250356/google-nexus-7-with-wifi-mobile-data.html\">Nexus 7</a> and iPad mini.

<article><section class=\"page\"><p>
On Monday, Qualcomm set out to wrest control of the tablet market from a number of tablet chip makers you’ve never heard of, integrating multimode 3G/4G LTE and other improvements inside its Snapdragon 400 application processor.
</p><p>
In addition to integrating multimode LTE for the Chinese market, Qualcomm published a reference design for 7-inch and 10-inch versions of the Snapdragon 400.
</p><p>
One of the problems that Qualcomm, Nvidia, and other chip providers face is that no-name Asian suppliers are eating their lunch. According to Strategy Analytics, a Chinese company called Allwinner Technologies supplied more microprocessors for tablets than both Qualcomm and rival Nvidia put together. <a href=\"http://www.eetimes.com/electronics-blogs/other/4413656/London-Calling-Did-Allwinner-outsell-Intel-Qualcomm\"><em>EE Times</em> reported last month</a> that Allwinner supplies chips for about half the price of either American supplier, meaning that Qualcomm either has to incresse the value of its chips or risk being undercut in the market.
</p><p>
Qualcomm’s answer, apparently, is multimode LTE—one of the features that the Asian market wants, according to the company. The Snapdragon 400 tier the first to offer multimode 3G/4G LTE on processors with both dual-and quad-core CPUs for high-volume smartphones, the company claimed, alongside other technologies, such as dual-SIM support, that customers have asked for.

Video game-themed bedrooms are nothing new, but this one really caught our attention. Lauren, a self-described “accountant/painter/gamer/adrenaline junkie/nerd/everything enthusiast” was not content with her bland apartment, and having just completed Portal 2, the discovery of the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=infinity+mirror&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=sBetUfS7F4vU9QToi4CQCQ&amp;ved=0CAoQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1600&amp;bih=775\">infinity mirror</a> was enough to convince her to design a Portal-themed room.
</p><p>
Lauren's room comes complete with a Portal Gun, Aperture Science paraphernalia, a portrait of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chell_(Portal)\">Chell</a> (the hero of Portal), and all the orange and blue you could ask for. Be sure to check out <a href=\"http://portalbedroom.wordpress.com/\">The Portal Bedroom homepage</a> for more images of this inspired design.

		Jonathan Seff"))) ("Getting the best bokeh in your background" "<article><section class=\"page\"><p>
Blurry photos are generally a bad thing. But although it's true that—with rare exception—no one likes camera shake in their photos, sometimes blur is intentional, such as when you shoot a photo with shallow depth of field so that the subject is sharp and the background is out of focus.
</p><p>
Within the blurry background, you often have lights or reflections—especially at night. In fact, the quality of the background on those highlights is something that photographers consider when taking the shot, and you can affect the look of your photo by tweaking that blurriness. There’s even a name for this effect—it’s called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bokeh\">bokeh</a>, and it comes from a Japanese word meaning “blur” or “haze.” Here's what I'm talking about; consider this detail from the background of a photo.
</p><figure class=\" large\"><a href=\"http://images.techhive.com/images/article/2013/05/bokeh01-100037280-orig.jpg\" class=\"zoom\"><img src=\"http://images.techhive.com/images/article/2013/05/bokeh01-100037280-large.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\" \" width=\"580\" height=\"384\"/></a><figcaption>These bright circles are a result of shooting lights or reflections out of focus, such as what you get in the background of a photo.</figcaption></figure><p>
In a nutshell, bokeh refers to the visual properties of blur. But before I go any further, first, some simple science: Where are the blurry dots coming from? Without getting too technical, I can say that bokeh happens when light rays pass through the camera lens and diffract around the lens aperture. As a result, the shape of the aperture gets repeated all over the background of the image. Often, the blur is not quite round, because the aperture isn’t perfectly round; typically it’s made from seven or nine metal blades—small metal surfaces that open and close inside the lens like a diaphragm—that approximate a circle. But if the aperture is shot wide open at the smallest f-number, then the blur will be a perfect circle.

So how do you shoot to get this effect? The most important thing you need is a scene that includes fairly small lights or reflections. The lights of a city at night, Christmas tree lights, or bits of light reflecting off leaves are all good candidates. Large lights or reflective surfaces won’t work if you shoot them too close.

Blurry photos are generally a bad thing. But although it's true that—with rare exception—no one likes camera shake in their photos, sometimes blur is intentional, such as when you shoot a photo with shallow depth of field so that the subject is sharp and the background is out of focus.

Car analogies are cliché in the audio world, but when I began reviewing MEElectronics’s $129 <strong><a href=\"http://www.meelec.com/MEElectronics_A161P_Balanced_Armature_Earphone_p/ep-a161p-bk-mee.htm\">A161P Balanced Armature In-Ear Headphone with Inline Microphone and Remote</a></strong> (let’s just call it the A161P), the first thing I thought of was a “<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeper_(car)\">sleeper</a>”: a car that looks modest inside and out, but packs serious power under the hood—the Volvo 850R wagon is a great example. By saving money on exterior finish and interior luxury, extra resources can be put into the bits that make the car go fast. (There’s the bonus that the car doesn’t attract undue attention, but that’s tangential here.) The A161P is a sleeper headphone.
</p><h2 id=\"intheear\">In the ear</h2><p>
Although the A161P doesn’t look cheap, it doesn’t look particularly fancy, either. The earpieces are small, black capsules printed with the company’s “MEE” logo and capped with a gold-colored nozzle that guides sound into your ears. That stem hosts a standard silicone eartip that allows the earpiece to seal in your ear. On the opposite end of the earpiece, substantial strain relief supports the headphone cable.
</p><p>
The A161p is a a <em>canalphone</em>-style headset. Headphones with this design typically fit snugly—and relatively deep—in your ear canals, blocking most external noise and creating a solid acoustic seal to improve bass performance. The downsides of canalphones are that some people find it tricky to get a proper fit; you may hear some <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microphonics\">microphonic</a> cable noise—bumps and scrapes of the cable that are amplified by the canalphones’ tight coupling with your ear canals; and using them as a headset can be weird due to the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occlusion_effect\">occlusion effect</a> of having your ears plugged while talking. (See our <a href=\"http://www.macworld.com/article/55152/2007/01/canalphones.html\">primer on in-ear-canal headphones</a> for more details.)
</p><p>
On the cable for the right-channel earpiece sits an inline, one-button remote and microphone module. (One of the missing luxuries here is a three-button, Apple-style remote/mic.) The cord itself is thin, but it feels reasonably sturdy, and it terminates in a 45-degree-angle, 3.5mm (1/8-inch) stereo miniplug.

		Loek Essers, IDG News Service"))) ("Review: Ticket to Ride brings train-centric chicanery to Android" "<article><section class=\"page\"><p class=\"Body\">Days of Wonders' classic Ticket to Ride is a board game about trains. Lots of them: hundred of little plastic pieces to dole out amongst your friends. There are also cards to shuffle through, points to track, and a great big cardboard map of the United States to lay out on a table. Fortunately for us civilized (or friendless) folk, digital versions of the game have been kicking around online, on PC and on iOS devices, allowing us to build railroad empires without needing to dedicate much in the way of furniture. Now <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.daysofwonder.tt.android\">Ticket to Ride</a> has finally arrived on Android devices in all its glory, and it's still all rather fun.
</p><p class=\"Body\">If you're new to the game (or just terrible, like me) an introductory video in the Android version explains all of the rules.

<article><section class=\"page\"><p class=\"Body\">Days of Wonders' classic Ticket to Ride is a board game about trains. Lots of them: hundred of little plastic pieces to dole out amongst your friends. There are also cards to shuffle through, points to track, and a great big cardboard map of the United States to lay out on a table. Fortunately for us civilized (or friendless) folk, digital versions of the game have been kicking around online, on PC and on iOS devices, allowing us to build railroad empires without needing to dedicate much in the way of furniture. Now <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.daysofwonder.tt.android\">Ticket to Ride</a> has finally arrived on Android devices in all its glory, and it's still all rather fun.
</p><p class=\"Body\">If you're new to the game (or just terrible, like me) an introductory video in the Android version explains all of the rules. Curiously, it's a video for the PC version, making references to double-clicking and showing all of the action on a PC monitor. The iPad version of the game gets its own dedicated video, so I'd imagine something Android-friendly will be popping up soon enough.

The room in which <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Mann\">Steve Mann</a>, the father of wearable computing, insists we do his interview is closed for the day, and Mann won’t answer any questions until we get the door open. It’s Tuesday afternoon, and I’ve come to the <a href=\"http://augmentedworldexpo.com/\">Augmented World Expo</a> in Santa Clara, California to speak to the University of Toronto professor about wearable technology and the ubiquity of surveillance. But now, instead of searching for answers, I’m searching for a key.
</p><p>Mann and I skitter through the conference halls, anxiously asking Expo employees if they can help us locate our mystical MacGuffin. After a few minutes of searching, Mann finds someone from his staff who can unlock the room. But first we have to help move Mann’s <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulophone\">hydraulophone</a>—a musical instrument of his own design that uses water to produce sound.
