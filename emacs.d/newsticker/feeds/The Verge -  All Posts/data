  <p>Believe it or not, we're coming up on the 20th anniversary of the massive critical and box-office bomb that was the <i>Super Mario Bros.</i> movie adaptation. Released May 28, 1993, the movie had the unfortunate timing to come out just two weeks ahead of another, much better cinematic adaptation involving dinosaurs that you may remember: <i>Jurassic Park</i>. Yet when it comes to evaluating each movie's place in Hollywood history, <i>Super Mario Bros</i>. may have actually been the more prescient of the two. That's the conclusion of Karina Longworth, who performed some cinematic paleontology for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/9123782/the-strange-case-super-mario-bros-movieex_cid=grantland33\"><i>Grantland</i></a>, re-reviewing the movie after playing the original NES game.

  <p>If you're of the opinion that politicians are unqualified to create tech policy, then know that Ben Fried, Google's chief information officer, largely agrees with you.</p>
<p>\"The current generation of lawmakers are probably not the best informed [about technological issues],\" Fried told an audience at Columbia University today. And for that reason, according to Fried, they're likely not the best people to answer important policy questions about tech. Fried made his comments as a part of a panel discussion on \"big data\" that included executives from Bloomberg, Microsoft, and Facebook.  </p>

  <p>In the latest of several swipes against patent trolls, Google has taken aim at the companies who sell off their patents so they can be used in lawsuits. Writing to the FTC and US Department of Justice, Google warned against \"patent privateering\" &mdash; by which it means outsourcing patent warfare by going through firms that don't make anything themselves and therefore can't be countersued. Patent trolls are almost universally reviled for aggressively suing companies on vague, sweeping patent claims. But Google claims the US government should turn its attention to the companies who created those patents in the first place.</p>

  <p>Scientists have used a custom-made 3D printer to make a synthetic tissue that could have a variety of applications &mdash; including the ability to transmit long-distance electric signals much like nerves. The process, <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/340/6128/48.abstract\" target=\"_blank\">published in <i>Science</i></a> by an Oxford University team led by Hagan Bayley, prints a network of droplets made out of aqueous solutions &mdash; a liquid mixture &mdash; instead of the solids that standard 3D printers produce.</p>
<p>The printer, made specifically for this experiment since already-existent models weren't up to the task, places tiny drops of liquid into an oil solution.

Predictably, <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/30/4164372/china-opposes-us-law-restricting-government-tech-imports/in/3709433\">China came out in strong opposition</a> to the provision &mdash; meant to shield the Justice Department, Department of Commerce, NASA, and the NSF against cyber espionage &mdash; and now Silicon Valley is taking issue with the restrictions. A number of industry trade associations have banded together and authored <a href=\"http://blog.itic.org/dotAsset/d2bae027-4a43-4d7f-b650-4a5a510ffc49.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">a letter to leaders on Capitol Hill</a> voicing their concern. \"Fundamentally, product security is a function of how a product is made, used, and maintained, not by whom or where it is made,\" the document reads.</p>
