(p nil "First, open-sourcing FeedDemon sounds nice, but I don't see it working. I use a number of commercial third-party components which can't be open-sourced, and some of them are older versions that I've modified quite a bit. Perhaps more importantly, FeedDemon was developed in Delphi 7, which is very " (a ((href . "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embarcadero_Delphi#Versions")) "out of date") ". Delphi geeks will recall that version was released before the product supported Unicode, so all the Unicode support you see in FeedDemon was added by me (using owner draw, custom string routines, etc.). Long story short: it would be easier to write a new RSS reader than it would be to upgrade FeedDemon's code to the latest Delphi version (which would need to be done).") (p nil "Second, switching to another sync service isn't practical. It's not as simple as just using a different set of endpoints for API calls, as some have suggested.

Reliably syncing RSS feeds is a " (strong nil "ton ") "of work, and as I mentioned in my previous post, I already have a full-time job as an Android developer and just wouldn't be able to devote extra time to switching sync platforms.") (p nil "I don't take the end of FeedDemon lightly - after all, it has occupied a huge chunk of my life since I created it back in 2003. But I haven't been able to give it any attention for quite some time, and it has earned very little for the past few years. Really, it's time for me to let it go.") (p nil "PS: As expected, the end of both Google Reader and FeedDemon have brought a fresh round of articles saying \"RSS is dead,\" which is way off-base. Google Reader and FeedDemon represent the \"old school\" of RSS readers: they were designed for geeks and held little mass-market appeal as a result. There are plenty of popular \"new school\" feed readers with new approaches, and most of them don't even call themselves RSS readers or even mention that they rely on RSS (which is a good thing, since most customers don't care about the plumbing).")

<p>When I built the Android version of <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sepialabs.glassboard\">Glassboard</a>, I decided not to do anything specific for Android 4. Based on Google's stats, it looked like it would be a <strong>very</strong> long time before enough people were running ICS for it to make sense spending any time supporting it.</p>
<p>But Google has made some <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/devices/details?id=galaxy_nexus_hspa\">smart</a> <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/devices/details?id=nexus_7_8gb\">moves</a> lately that should speed up the adoption of Android 4. I think it'll become the leading Android version much sooner than expected.</p>
<p>So I decided we needed to support ICS in Glassboard as soon as possible. Now, in fact.</p>
<p>If you're running ICS and would like to test drive a Glassboard build that takes advantage of ICS features like the ActionBar and hardware acceleration, you can <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sepialabs.glassboard\">download the APK here</a>. If all goes well, this build will be uploaded to Google Play in a few days.</p>
<p>If you run into any problems with it, I hope you'll let me know by posting in my \"Android Testers\" board (you can join using the <a href=\"http://nick.typepad.com/blog/2012/05/on-glassboard-20-nobody-knows-youre-a-dog.html\">invitation code</a> <code><strong>ckanq</strong></code>).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS: This build still supports every version of Android from 2.2 upwards - it just takes advantage of ICS features when running on Android 4.</p></div>

<p>When I built the Android version of <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sepialabs.glassboard\">Glassboard</a>, I decided not to do anything specific for Android 4. Based on Google's stats, it looked like it would be a <strong>very</strong> long time before enough people were running ICS for it to make sense spending any time supporting it.</p>
<p>But Google has made some <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/devices/details?id=galaxy_nexus_hspa\">smart</a> <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/devices/details?id=nexus_7_8gb\">moves</a> lately that should speed up the adoption of Android 4. I think it'll become the leading Android version much sooner than expected.</p>
<p>So I decided we needed to support ICS in Glassboard as soon as possible. Now, in fact.</p>
<p>If you're running ICS and would like to test drive a Glassboard build that takes advantage of ICS features like the ActionBar and hardware acceleration, you can <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sepialabs.glassboard\">download the APK here</a>. If all goes well, this build will be uploaded to Google Play in a few days.</p>
<p>If you run into any problems with it, I hope you'll let me know by posting in my \"Android Testers\" board (you can join using the <a href=\"http://nick.typepad.com/blog/2012/05/on-glassboard-20-nobody-knows-youre-a-dog.html\">invitation code</a> <code><strong>ckanq</strong></code>).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS: This build still supports every version of Android from 2.2 upwards - it just takes advantage of ICS features when running on Android 4.</p></div>

<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p><b>Update:</b> This build is now live on <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sepialabs.glassboard\">Google Play</a>.</p>

<p>When I built the Android version of <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sepialabs.glassboard\">Glassboard</a>, I decided not to do anything specific for Android 4. Based on Google's stats, it looked like it would be a <strong>very</strong> long time before enough people were running ICS for it to make sense spending any time supporting it.</p>
<p>But Google has made some <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/devices/details?id=galaxy_nexus_hspa\">smart</a> <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/devices/details?id=nexus_7_8gb\">moves</a> lately that should speed up the adoption of Android 4. I think it'll become the leading Android version much sooner than expected.</p>
<p>So I decided we needed to support ICS in Glassboard as soon as possible. Now, in fact.</p>
<p>If you're running ICS and would like to test drive a Glassboard build that takes advantage of ICS features like the ActionBar and hardware acceleration, you can <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sepialabs.glassboard\">download the APK here</a>. If all goes well, this build will be uploaded to Google Play in a few days.</p>
<p>If you run into any problems with it, I hope you'll let me know by posting in my \"Android Testers\" board (you can join using the <a href=\"http://nick.typepad.com/blog/2012/05/on-glassboard-20-nobody-knows-youre-a-dog.html\">invitation code</a> <code><strong>ckanq</strong></code>).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS: This build still supports every version of Android from 2.2 upwards - it just takes advantage of ICS features when running on Android 4.</p></div>
