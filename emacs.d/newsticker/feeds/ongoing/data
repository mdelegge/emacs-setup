re-authentication?”  A bit of background is in order. The way being an RP works
is that you do a browser redirect over to the IDP, in effect asking “Is this
the person they say they are?”
If you do this with Facebook or Google or whoever, and if
the person is already logged in via that browser, most times the IDP will just
come back and say “Yep, they’re authenticated” without pestering the user.") (p nil "But some RPs want to make the IDP re-authenticate, that is to say make the
person at the browser type in a password and maybe do the 2-factor thing too.
Because they’re about to do something really meaningful, involving money or
privacy or whatever.
For example, I was recently talking to some people from a well-known newspaper
that wanted to force re-auth when their journalists accessed the internal
publishing system from outside the firewall.") (h2 ((id . "p-3")) "Why Is That a Problem?") (p nil "Well, one of the key advantages Federated Identity is cutting down the

locally by forcing re-auth in some situation or another.  But they’re globally
reducing the security of the whole password ecosystem.") (h2 ((id . "p-4")) "What To Do?") (p nil "Well, an IDP can just say “No, you can’t do that.”  But that doesn’t really
make me happy either.  If you’re providing a service, and someone using it
says “I want to do X”, and you find yourself about to say “But you shouldn’t
want to do X” for any value of X, you should be nervous.") (p nil "And then there’s the elephant in the room: Policy and Regulation. Quite
possibly it’s not the people running the RP system, it’s the lawyers saying
“Let’s be safe and make them re-authenticate.”  Because how could it be wrong
to be more careful?") (p nil "And worse, maybe it’s the lawyers saying “The law says we " (em nil "have to") "

the person is already logged in via that browser, most times the IDP will just
come back and say “Yep, they’re authenticated” without pestering the user.") (p nil "But some RPs want to make the IDP re-authenticate, that is to say make the
