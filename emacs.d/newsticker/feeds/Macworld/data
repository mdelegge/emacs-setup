A: AppleScript can quickly access a ton of folders on your Mac, without requiring you to specify the actual path. To do this, you use the <code>path to</code> command and specify the folder you want, such as the Library, Preferences, Downloads, and so on. This command also lets you specify whether you want the folder in the user domain (your home folder), the local domain (the computer level), or the system domain (the system level). Here are some examples.

Microsoft has reminded customers running Office for Mac 2008 that support for the suite ends next Tuesday.
</p><p>
“Support for Office for Mac 2008 will end April 9, 2013,” Microsoft’s Mac Business Unit (MacBU), the firm’s OS X development arm, said in a <a href=\"http://blog.officeformac.com/ending-support-for-office-for-mac-2008/\">post on the team’s blog</a> Thursday.
</p><p>
According to the <a href=\"http://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle/?p1=12853\">company’s support lifecycle site</a>, all versions of the 2008 suite will be retired next week. Office for Mac 2008 launched Jan. 15, 2008, or about five years and three months ago.
</p><p>
The MacBU’s note was yet another reminder that Microsoft shortchanges customers running OS X. Microsoft supports the Windows versions of Office, even those that target consumers, for 10 years, or twice as long as it does Office for the Mac.

I'm terrible at keeping track of things, so much so that my dentist once threatened to put a GPS tracker on me. I typically operate on a day-to-day basis; my appointments either involve me arriving three hours early or breathless, panic-stricken and just in the nick of time. As such, I kind of took as a little bit of serendipity when I started using <a href=\"http://www.6wunderkinder.com/wunderlist\">6Wundkinder's</a> free <strong><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/wunderlist/id406644151?mt=8\">Wunderlist 2.0</a></strong>. Finally, a tool designed to help me fix my pathological lack of organization.
</p><p><span style=\"line-height: 1.45em;\">A reboot of the Berlin-based app company’s already popular to-do list manager, Wunderlist 2.0 is buttery-smooth and almost completely painless to make use of. Its smart lists (which ensure that you'll never see anything but what is most relevant), in-app notifications, e-mail alerts, and Facebook integration are just some of the features that make Wunderlist a breeze to utilize.</span></p><figure class=\"left medium\"><a href=\"http://images.techhive.com/images/article/2013/04/wunderlist-100032015-large.png\" class=\"zoom\"><img src=\"http://images.techhive.com/images/article/2013/04/wunderlist-100032015-medium.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\" \" width=\"300\" height=\"400\"/></a><figcaption/></figure><p>
Depending on the device you're running the app on—it’s a universal app for all iOS devices and runs as a browser extension and a Mac app as well—the actual look of Wunderlist’s interface might vary somewhat, but it seems to follow the same basic formula. A menu bar along the left-hand side keeps track of what lists you’re working with. To add a new to-do list, simply tap “add a list” and give it a name. When in a specific list, touch the top input box labeled “add an item,” and you'll be able to add items one by one. Hit next to continue increasing your stable of tasks, hit done to finish. In this respect, Wunderlist is all but elementary.
</p><p><span style=\"line-height: 1.45em;\">Things get a little more interesting and a tad more elaborate once you start fine-tuning individual tasks. With Wunderlist 2.0, you won't just be assigning an alert to item, but you also have the ability to generate sub-tasks, due dates, notes, reminders, and even recurring tasks around an item. It can’t force users to want to make lists, but helps the organizationally challenged stay on top of things.</span></p><p class=\"jumpTag\"><a href=\"/article/2033028/review-the-revamped-wunderlist-2-0-sports-shared-lists-better-organizational-tools-for-ios.html#jump\">To read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here</a></p></section></article>") (link nil "http://www.macworld.com/article/2033028/review-the-revamped-wunderlist-2-0-sports-shared-lists-better-organizational-tools-for-ios.html#tk.rss_all") (media:thumbnail ((url .

An iOS device isn’t perfect for every photographic need. But it can serve awfully well in many situations where you might once have needed a digital camera.
</p><p>The simplest way to shoot photos and video with your iPhone is to use Apple’s built-in Camera app. The app launches by default in still-image mode; you can take a shot by tapping the <em>Camera</em> icon at the bottom of the screen or by pressing the <em>Volume Up</em> or <em>Volume Down</em> button. Switch between the front and back cameras by tapping the <em>Camera </em>icon (with the circular arrows) in the upper right corner; shoot video or photos by tapping the <em>Photos/Video</em> slider in the bottom right corner in portrait mode (or in the upper right corner in landscape mode).
</p><h2>Frame your subject</h2><p>Photographers and artists alike adhere to the “rule of thirds,” which says that photos look better when the subject is off-center, aligned about a third of the way from the right or left, or top or bottom <span>(the same holds true for video—just look at TV shows and movies for proof).</span><span> Imagine that the image area is divided by two equally spaced horizontal lines and two equally spaced vertical lines, </span>According to the rule of thirds, the most visually interesting parts of the image should be positioned along any one of the lines, or at any point where the lines intersect.

<div><section class=\"page\"><p>Sometimes the iTunes Guy gets questions where the only answer is, “sorry, you can’t”. This week’s column covers a couple of questions with no solutions, along with some that do have answers. Learn about finding missing podcast playlists, replacing converted songs in their playlists, and more.
</p><p><strong>Q: I have a lot of songs in MP3 format, and have started converting them to AAC format to save space on my computer. When doing so, iTunes creates a duplicate version of the song in AAC format, leaving behind the MP3 file. When I delete the MP3 from within iTunes, it removes the songs from all my playlists. I would like to simply convert the song to AAC format, replacing the old MP3 format so that the playlists now reference the AAC version of the song and not the MP3. Is this possible? </strong></p><p>Putting aside the fact that I don’t usually suggest converting from one lossy audio file type to another, no, iTunes considers each file to be unique. When you convert a file, you then have two files, and it wouldn’t make sense to add the new files to a playlist, in case you wanted to keep them both. (Because you most likely wouldn’t want two copies of the songs in the playlists.)

<div><section class=\"page\"><p>
Our smartphones are probably one of the most expensive things we carry around each day. But given that iPhones are anything but cheap, why are so many of us surprisingly cheap when browsing the virtual shelves of the App Store? Ironically enough, that tendency to be cheap may end up proving costly in the long run.
</p><p>
It’s no shocker that free apps are vastly more popular than paid apps; everyone likes getting something for nothing. But it is surprising that folks consider a $3 app expensive, and a $10 app downright exorbitant. I know people who play the same iOS game every single day, but choose to stick with the free version—despite its constant, intrusive ads—rather than pony up $5 just once to go ad-free forever.
</p><p>
Of the top 20 best-selling iPhone apps, 15 of them cost $1; the priciest one costs $7. The average price of the top 100 paid apps in the App Store is less than $2.
</p><p>
I’m neither an economist nor a psychologist, but it strikes me that too many iOS device owners fail to act in their own best interests—both in the immediate near term and in the long term—when they scoff at the thought of spending money in the App Store. Here’s how customers who spend lavishly on iOS hardware punish themselves by skimping on apps.

When customers in the Apple ecosystem shop for wireless speakers, the biggest consideration is whether to go with <a href=\"http://www.macworld.com/article/1144084/speakers_buying_guide.html\">Bluetooth or AirPlay</a>. And the argument has long gone that AirPlay’s decided advantages—higher-quality audio and longer, Wi-Fi-based range—come with one significant disadvantage: AirPlay speakers cost substantially more than their Bluetooth counterparts. But it appears that Pioneer is looking to change that.
</p><p>

<article><section class=\"page\"><p>
When customers in the Apple ecosystem shop for wireless speakers, the biggest consideration is whether to go with <a href=\"http://www.macworld.com/article/1144084/speakers_buying_guide.html\">Bluetooth or AirPlay</a>. And the argument has long gone that AirPlay’s decided advantages—higher-quality audio and longer, Wi-Fi-based range—come with one significant disadvantage: AirPlay speakers cost substantially more than their Bluetooth counterparts. But it appears that Pioneer is looking to change that.

</p><p>
Among the changes in the latest Mountain Lion update are improved compatibility with certain enterprise Wi-Fi networks, better Microsoft Exchange compatibility in Calendar, a fix for issues with FaceTime calls to non-U.S. phone numbers, and—to cries of joy heard round the world—a solution for an issue where iMessages might show up up out of order in Messages.

A new version of Safari, 6.0.5, is included in the download as well; Apple says it improves stability for some websites with chat features and games. (Not that anybody uses the Web for chatting or playing games, right?)
</p><p>
Additionally, Calendar birthdays should no longer appear incorrectly in certain time zones, VoiceOver compatibility for text in PDFs should be better, and an issue where the desktop background picture wasn’t correctly preserved after restart should be fixed.

That confusion finally ended when Apple recently <a href=\"http://www.techhive.com/article/2040300/apple-reveals-16gb-ipod-touch-with-no-rear-facing-camera.html\">introduced a 4-inch 16GB iPod touch</a> and in the process killed off the older fourth-generation for good.

The 16GB model is in fact notable only for what it lacks: It offers no rear-facing iSight camera, no strap post (and therefore no strap), and no choice in colors (this model comes only with a black face and silver back).
</p><p>
Given that it has no new or improved capabilities over its higher-capacity siblings, your buying choice is nicely narrowed down to just a few factors: Money, storage space, and what you want from an iPod touch’s camera.

If you’ve perused the Internet in the last little while, you’re probably aware of the rumors of Apple’s “iRadio” service—a streaming music service that would (if it became real) provide Pandora-like functionality to computers via iTunes, as well as to iOS devices. Such rumors naturally provoke questions: If such a thing existed, how would it differ from Pandora and other streaming services? And given that Pandora and its ilk do exist, what can Apple bring to the party that isn’t already there? Let the conjecture begin.
</p><h2>Radio versus on-demand</h2><p>
Let’s first clarify what kind of service we’re talking about. Currently there are two commercial music streaming models. The first is a Pandora-like service, where you have no choice over the specific tracks you listen to, but rather you create stations based on particular songs, artists, and albums you enjoy. By rating the music streamed to you with a simple thumbs up or thumbs down, you fine-tune the station to the point where everything you hear is, at the very least, tolerable. At best, it’s familiar music you love and unfamiliar music that you’ll cotton to.
</p><figure class=\" large\"><img src=\"http://images.techhive.com/images/article/2013/06/pandoraone-100040410-large.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\" \" width=\"580\" height=\"510\"/><figcaption>Pandora is the service to beat in streaming radio.</figcaption></figure><p>
The other model is on-demand streaming. This is practiced by such services as <a href=\"http://www.techhive.com/article/2000051/which-music-subscription-service-should-you-use.html\">MOG, Rdio, Rhapsody, Slacker, Spotify</a>, and <a href=\"https://play.google.com/about/music/\">Google’s All Access</a>. With these services you can choose specific tracks, albums, artists, and genres to listen to. They also let you create playlists and download tracks to mobile devices. Additionally, each offers a feature similar to Pandora where you can stream stations or channels based on a selection—an artist or genre, for example.
</p><h2>Why radio?</h2><p>
All rumors of Apple’s service have pointed to radio rather than on-demand streaming. And that leads some people to wonder why, when Google has jumped into on-demand listening and Spotify seems to be getting ever-greater attention, Apple would take what appears to be the less interesting path.

But the rumor mill (coupled with our own boundless optimism) suggests that Apple may use WWDC to bring a refresh or two to the Mac line as well.
</p><p>Last year, Apple CEO Tim Cook <a href=\"http://www.macworld.com/article/1167247/cook_apple_planning_professional_mac_for_2013.html\">told a customer inquiring about the Mac Pro</a> that the company was “working on something really great for [2013].” Whether that means that the company is planning an updated version of its high-end Mac, or some sort of a replacement for it, WWDC seems like a reasonable place for Apple to unveil whatever Cook was talking about. After all, developers love power, and the Mac Pro (or its successor) is all about power. Absolute power corrupts absolutely; developers would absolutely go nuts for an announcement of this sort.

<article><section class=\"page\"><p>The only thing we know for certain that we can expect from Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference keynote next week is a preview of the next versions of iOS and OS X—and that’s only because Apple exec <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2013/04/24Apple-Worldwide-Developers-Conference-to-Kick-Off-June-10-in-San-Francisco.html\">Phil Schiller said so</a> in a press release. But the rumor mill (coupled with our own boundless optimism) suggests that Apple may use WWDC to bring a refresh or two to the Mac line as well.
</p><p>Last year, Apple CEO Tim Cook <a href=\"http://www.macworld.com/article/1167247/cook_apple_planning_professional_mac_for_2013.html\">told a customer inquiring about the Mac Pro</a> that the company was “working on something really great for [2013].” Whether that means that the company is planning an updated version of its high-end Mac, or some sort of a replacement for it, WWDC seems like a reasonable place for Apple to unveil whatever Cook was talking about. After all, developers love power, and the Mac Pro (or its successor) is all about power. Absolute power corrupts absolutely; developers would absolutely go nuts for an announcement of this sort.

The new Any.do Cal application will include contact, location, and social integration so that you can send messages and plan meetings or events from within the app itself. And the app integrates with Any.DO itself, so that you can manage your schedule and to-dos by entering your data just once, in either app. The calendar app also seems to retain the spare, elegant design sensibility of the original Any.DO application.
</p><p><em>Macworld</em> got a chance to look at a beta version of the app. As with Any.DO, you can sign in with Facebook or register an account with your email; the app will then ask for access to your phone's contacts and calendar. The default setting of the app is to show you today's appointments, with a banner across the top showing you the present week. You can scroll forward or back through the weeks with the banner, or pull down for a view of the full month—the app is full of swipey fun. Adding an event and inviting others to join should be no challenge to anybody who has ever used their phone's native Calendar app.

Any.DO's developers promise a Zen sense of time management, so any free space in the app is taken up with pictures of wildlife.

Standzout's $100 <strong><a href=\"http://www.standzout.com\">Standzfree Telescoping Floor Stand for iPad</a></strong> is a tall, upright stand that lets you get your iPad off your desk or table and position it virtually anyplace in your home or office. With its long, flexible extender (which looks something like a gooseneck lamp, only somewhat stiffer), it gives you myriad of ways to position your tablet, and a telescoping tube extends the stand from 36 to 48 inches in height. (You’ll likely bend the neck at least somewhat, taking a few inches off the totoal height.)
</p><figure class=\"right medium\"><a href=\"http://images.techhive.com/images/article/2013/04/lxobue9fwiagq5z9ccc-iyfapzv5yr5jxxbdsmh-nbw_u7dyxikiclvdheoqfj5rmgt290e__3ln_iqv1nh69u-100034512-orig.jpeg\" class=\"zoom\"><img src=\"http://images.techhive.com/images/article/2013/04/lxobue9fwiagq5z9ccc-iyfapzv5yr5jxxbdsmh-nbw_u7dyxikiclvdheoqfj5rmgt290e__3ln_iqv1nh69u-100034512-medium.jpeg\" border=\"0\" alt=\" \" width=\"300\" height=\"472\"/></a><figcaption/></figure><p>
The Standzfree best-suited for passive viewing of your iPad’s screen: watching videos or reading in bed (especially while lying down), sitting on the couch, standing with your instrument in front of musical notation, on the exercise bike, and in other situations where you want to view your iPad close up without having to hold it. That said, the Standzfree is acceptably stable for typing and swiping, if required—the six-pound stand is sturdy, and the weighted, V-shape base does not budge, even on thick carpet.
</p><p>
Like a piece of assemble-at-home furniture, the Standzfree ships in a long box; you unpack and assemble the pieces. This was a very simple procedure—I didn’t need the directions to figure out what went where. A plastic ball joint at the top of the stand fits into the socket on the back of the frame, with a screw cap holding them together. You loosen this screw cap to adjust the position of the tablet in an infinite number of ways—landscape, portrait, or anything in between.
</p><p>
However, as with some of the DIY furniture I’ve used, everything wasn’t perfectly clear when it came to using the stand. Specifically, I had some questions as to how to get the adjustable-height tube section working properly. The answer: Make sure that the first time you adjust the height, you move the inner ring that's on the goose neck part of the stand. Doing so requires removing the ring from the telescoping base, and moving it with your hand. When you place the ring back in the base, it's then easy to adjust the height of the stand and use the screw cap to tighten it in position.

</p><figure class=\"right medium\"><a href=\"http://images.techhive.com/images/article/2013/04/lxobue9fwiagq5z9ccc-iyfapzv5yr5jxxbdsmh-nbw_u7dyxikiclvdheoqfj5rmgt290e__3ln_iqv1nh69u-100034512-orig.jpeg\" class=\"zoom\"><img src=\"http://images.techhive.com/images/article/2013/04/lxobue9fwiagq5z9ccc-iyfapzv5yr5jxxbdsmh-nbw_u7dyxikiclvdheoqfj5rmgt290e__3ln_iqv1nh69u-100034512-medium.jpeg\" border=\"0\" alt=\" \" width=\"300\" height=\"472\"/></a><figcaption/></figure><p>
The Standzfree best-suited for passive viewing of your iPad’s screen: watching videos or reading in bed (especially while lying down), sitting on the couch, standing with your instrument in front of musical notation, on the exercise bike, and in other situations where you want to view your iPad close up without having to hold it. That said, the Standzfree is acceptably stable for typing and swiping, if required—the six-pound stand is sturdy, and the weighted, V-shape base does not budge, even on thick carpet.
</p><p>
Like a piece of assemble-at-home furniture, the Standzfree ships in a long box; you unpack and assemble the pieces. This was a very simple procedure—I didn’t need the directions to figure out what went where. A plastic ball joint at the top of the stand fits into the socket on the back of the frame, with a screw cap holding them together. You loosen this screw cap to adjust the position of the tablet in an infinite number of ways—landscape, portrait, or anything in between.
</p><p>
However, as with some of the DIY furniture I’ve used, everything wasn’t perfectly clear when it came to using the stand. Specifically, I had some questions as to how to get the adjustable-height tube section working properly. The answer: Make sure that the first time you adjust the height, you move the inner ring that's on the goose neck part of the stand. Doing so requires removing the ring from the telescoping base, and moving it with your hand. When you place the ring back in the base, it's then easy to adjust the height of the stand and use the screw cap to tighten it in position.

		Jason Snell"))) ("How to correct colors in Final Cut Pro X" "<article><section class=\"page\"><p>
Color correction—also known as color grading or color timing—is the process of altering the brightness and color values of an image or video. While many of today’s modern video cameras (and still cameras that shoot video) can produce great-looking shots automatically, sometimes you’ll still want to manipulate the color “in post.” Common reasons for doing so include:
</p><ul><li>Correcting for mistakes you made during the shoot, such as over- or underexposure or incorrect white balance.</li><li>Matching shots taken at different times and/or locations so that they look as if they were captured at the same time and place.</li><li>Creating a particular look or style to support a mood, such as making a scene appear bright, warm, and cheery, or dark, cold, and foreboding.</li></ul><p>
Regardless of your goal, Final Cut Pro X includes powerful tools for grading your video. Let’s get familiar with them as we explore the basics of color correction.
</p><h2>Tools: Color Board and Video Scopes</h2><p>
The primary tool for correcting video in Final Cut Pro X is called the Color Board. With the playhead over a clip in your project that you want to correct, open the Inspector (press Command-4 or click the <em>Inspector</em> button in the toolbar) and select the <em>Video</em> pane if necessary.
</p><figure class=\" large\"><a href=\"http://images.techhive.com/images/article/2013/05/1-making-correction-100038406-orig.jpg\" class=\"zoom\"><img src=\"http://images.techhive.com/images/article/2013/05/1-making-correction-100038406-large.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\" \" width=\"580\" height=\"515\"/></a><figcaption>The color tools in the Video Inspector.</figcaption></figure><p>
The Color section contains three tools for adjusting the color of a clip. The first, Balance, attempts to fix the brightness and color values of a clip automatically. To try it, just click the box to the left to enable it. The next tool, Match Color, is great for matching one shot to another. All you need to do is click the <em>Choose</em> button and then click a clip you want to match to. Both of these tools are simple and useful, but they are also one-trick ponies—either they work or they don’t.
