<p>Except it hasn't said that, quite. But it is, and saying so is really important.</p>
<p>The market-research firm predicts a 7.6% decline in PC sales this year, to 315 million units (including desktops and notebooks) from the roughly 341 million PCs sold in 2012. The real knife in the PC's heart, though, is that Gartner is now finally willing to predict a long-term decline: 302 million PCs in 2014, falling to 272 million in 2017, approaching the sales levels of 2006 and 2007.&nbsp;</p>
<p>\"While there will be some individuals who retain both a personal PC and a tablet, especially those who use either or both for work and play, most will be satisfied with the experience they get from a tablet as their main computing device,\" said Carolina Milanesi, research vice president at Gartner, in a statement. \"As consumers shift their time away from their PC to tablets and smartphones, they will no longer see their PC as a device that they need to replace on a regular basis.\"</p>
<p><span class=\"embedded-Media-image img-caption-c\">
				<img src=\"http://readwrite.com/files/Gartner%202013%20pc%2C%20tablet%20data.png\" style=\"\" />
			</span>
</p>
<p>Gartner predicted that tablet sales would outpace the PC market sometime between 2014 and and 2017. By then, the firm predicted, manufacturers will sell 468 million tablets, almost double that of the PC market. Phone sales will top 2 billion units.</p>
<h2>What Gartner Can't Say, And Why</h2>
<p>Gartner, however, can't bring itself to say the PC market is shrinking toward irrelevance. Instead, it describes the PC market as \"transitional,\" in much the same way companies firing large swathes of their workforces insist that employees have been \"downsized.\" If Gartner was a brokerage firm, its analyst would have placed a \"hold\" rating on the PC market, with all the wishy-washy implications that word connotes.</p>
<p>\"Transitional\" is one of those wussy words that says nothing. Here it's designed primarily to protect the lucrative relationship that Gartner has with its clients. If Gartner declares an industry dead, why should a company like Dell spend thousands of dollars a pop for a report that says so?</p>
<p>\"An analyst cannot issue a sell rating because he doesn't want to lose access,'' <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aaQDUAN2hm5Q\" target=\"_blank\">former securities analyst Tom Larsen told Bloomberg</a>&nbsp;in 2007. Exactly.</p>
<p>To Gartner's credit, the company began <a href=\"http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/1479114\" target=\"_blank\">hedging its bets</a> way back into 2010, when the company noted five \"disruptive forces\" challenging the PC industry, which I've condensed to three below:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\" data-mce-mark=\"1\">Stale \"mature markets\" like the United States;</span></li>
<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\" data-mce-mark=\"1\">Thin clients;</span></li>
<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\">A shift in consumer purchasing habits to tablets and other mobile devices that would displace PC sales and incline companies and individuals to keep PCs longer.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Only that last point appears prescient today — and only if you forget that Gartner issued its report in Nov. 2010, seven months after Apple launched the iPad.</p>
<h2>Why Gartner's Hedging Matters</h2>
<p>On balance, then, Gartner's report is nothing more than a reactive sell-side Wall Street analyst which issues a \"sell\" recommendation after a company has already issued bad news that's tanked its stock. The PC industry is dying, so let's move on.</p>
<p>But we actually need a company like Gartner to declare the PC dead — or at least to release data that supports that view, as it's just done, because companies across all industries use reports from Gartner, IDC, and others to justify their investments.</p>
<p>In order to develop a new PC version of TurboTax, for example, Intuit must demonstrate that there's a market for it. Gartner's report indicates that Intuit and other PC developers should consider abandoning the PC in favor of either a Web service or dedicated applications for various mobile platforms, at least if they want to address a market that's growing instead of shrinking.</p>
<p>We've known since 2010 that mobile devices would play an ever increasing role in our lives. But it's become increasingly clear that the cycle may be accelerating.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over at his blog Tech-Thoughts, analyst Sameer Singh noted recently that developers are already picking up on this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[T]he growth of Windows 8 apps has noticeably slowed in Q1 2013.&nbsp;According to the data, the Windows Store is expected to top 50,000 apps by the end of March, but MoM [month-over-month] growth has slowed to just 10-15%.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the trend continues, the reasons for buying a new PC also decline. Microsoft has begun paying small developers a pittance — <a href=\"http://build.windowsstore.com/keepthecash\" target=\"_blank\">$100 per app</a> — to develop for the Windows 8 platform. But that's barely going to pay for a round of beer and appetizers at the end of the day.</p>
<p>\"Microsoft's promotion is primarily aimed at low-end publishers,\" Singh wrote. \"Their prime concern at the moment isn't app quality, but quantity. Unless the app growth on the Windows Store remains strong, Microsoft has very little chance of attracting many major developers to the platform.\"</p>
<p>Gartner's data would indicate that Microsoft faces long odds there. Even if Gartner's too scared to say it.</p>

While these legitimate apps aren't stealing passwords, they're still riding roughshod over user privacy by gratuitously sucking up your contact and location information — or worse.
<h2>What These Bad Apps Glom Onto</h2>
<p>Between last September and March, security vendor <a href=\"http://www.bitdefender.com/news/user-privacy-plunges-as-android-aggressive-adware-and-malware-rise-2732.html\" target=\"_blank\">Bitdefender analyzed 130,000 popular Android apps</a> on Google Play and found that roughly 13% collected your phone number without explicit notification, 12% stored your location data and 8% sucked up your email address. Included in those numbers are apps that siphoned off one or more of the three.</p>
<p>Many apps don't stop there. Other data they glom onto includes your browsing activity, your contact list, the unique identification number of your device and even your call registry.</p>
<p>These apps took all that information legally. Android apps display their privacy policies in seeking permission to gather personal data, and many developers bank on the fact that most people will just click through to the app.</p>
<p><strong style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\">(See also:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://readwrite.com/2013/02/28/android-apps-less-risky-to-privacy-than-ios-apps\" target=\"_blank\">Hey! iOS Apps Play Faster And Looser With Your Data Than Android</a>)</strong></p>
<p>All that data gathering typically starts when an app developer download an ad framework provided by more than 400 companies listed on the <a href=\"http://www.adnetworkdirectory.com/\" target=\"_self\">Ad Network Directory</a>. Such frameworks makes it easy for developers to display ads in the app, and thus to get paid every time someone clicks on them.</p>
<p>Since free apps only make money for developers from such clicks (and, it turns out, the distribution of associated user data), very few pay attention to exactly what kind of information ad frameworks are gathering.</p>
<p>\"Because they copy-paste the code, they don't really debug it; they don't really look through it and see what data it collects,\" Bitdefender researcher Liviu Arsene told me. \"I bet they don't even care.\"</p>
<h2>And It Doesn't Stop There</h2>
<p>App privacy policies often stake out even more aggressive data-collection goals, presumably to pave the way for future updates to vacuum up more info and further erode user privacy.</p>
<p>Take, for instance, <a href=\"http://www.airpush.com/\" target=\"_self\">Airpush</a>, the second-largest ad network for Android developers with 40,000 apps. Its privacy policy reads, in part:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[I]n accordance with the permissions you have granted, we may collect your device ID, device make and model, device IP address, mobile web browser type and version, mobile carrier, real-time location information, email address, phone number and a list of the mobile applications on your device.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The policy goes on to explain that Airpush might supply that information to third-party advertisers who are part of its ad platform and third-party vendors, consultants and other service providers. Because the data is available to so many organizations, it's virtually impossible to know who is using your personal data, and how, once it leaves the device.</p>
<p>Obviously, the possibilities for abuse here are legion. Suppose one of those third-party organizations is acquired by an outfit that is, shall we say, less reputable. Or that a third party company's computers are hacked, spilling your data into the hands of cybercriminals.</p>
<h2>The Feds Agree: It's A Huge Problem</h2>
<p>Federal regulators acknowledge that a <a href=\"http://readwrite.com/2013/02/26/ftc-to-smartphone-makers-fix-security-or-end-up-like-htc#feed=/search?keyword=path%20ftc\" target=\"_self\">huge problem exists</a>. \"Mobile technology provides unique privacy challenges,\" Jon Leibowitz, departing chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, said in February, <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324610504578280061546792322.html?KEYWORDS=+ad+networks%20\" target=\"_self\">as reported</a> by The Wall Street Journal. \"Some would say it's a sort of Wild West.\"</p>
<p>The FTC wants the mobile industry to bolster privacy controls by allowing phone users to opt out of being tracked by ad networks. The commission also wants apps to prominently display the kind of data they're collecting, rather than burying it in fine print.&nbsp;Congress is also considering proposals to tighten privacy protections on mobile devices, though it's hard to say how such measures will fare given firm opposition from industry.</p>
<p>In the meantime, here's some free (!!) advice: Scrutinize your free mobile apps as if they're&nbsp;malware ready to wreak havoc on your personal information.</p>

Does Apple care?</p>
<p>Probably not, although it should. More than an app, though not quite a operating system, Facebook Home delivers a highly visual, system-wide presentation of real-time social data that also makes innovative use of touch-based gestures. In the process, it makes iOS look, well, dated.</p>
<p>Jony Ive, call your office.</p>
<h2>Why Apple Shouldn't Worry About Home</h2>
<p>In the short term, Apple has relatively little to fear. Tech blogger and Apple enthusiast <a style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\" href=\"http://readwrite.com/author/dan-frommer\" target=\"_blank\">Dan Frommer</a>, for instance,&nbsp;argues that Apple retains a \"big lead in hardware and OS quality, apps, media, and customer service\" — and that as a result, we shouldn't expect to see&nbsp;<a style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\" href=\"http://www.splatf.com/2013/04/facebook-phone-potential/\" target=\"_blank\">iPhone users bolt to Facebook phones</a>, at least not yet. Instead,&nbsp;he figures Facebook Home will likely appeal to buyers of low-end Android devices.</p>
<p><strong>(See also: <a href=\"http://readwrite.com/2013/04/04/facebook-home-a-facebook-phone-and-a-new-facebook-mobile-experience\">Facebook Home: A Slick Interface &amp; A Big Challenge</a>)</strong></p>
<p>Mobile analyst <a href=\"http://ben-evans.com\" target=\"_blank\">Benedict Evans</a> told me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The barriers to switching between platforms are pretty large: a slightly easier way to access Facebook Messenger won't be enough to make people make the switch. That's particularly the case for iPhone, which has a 70-80% repurchase intention rate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similarly, from Asymco analyst&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.asymco.com\" target=\"_blank\">Horace Dediu</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the phone business there are three things which define a product's volume: distribution, distribution and distribution.&nbsp;Home is a more ambitious version of an app (designed to extract more from the user) and so it is more constrained in all three areas. It needs \"permission\" from device makers, platform vendors and operators in order to proliferate. End user installation is an option but it's not likely to drive large volumes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dediu's quick analysis of Home leads him to believe that it could drive up to 10 million units a year. That's not nothing, of course, but still a pittance compared to the approximately 48 million iPhones Apple sold just last quarter.</p>
<h2>Why Apple Should Worry About Home</h2>
<p>Home, however, could have a significant long-term impact on iPhone's app-centric user interface. This might be to Apple's benefit.</p>

<p>At yesterday's Home launch, Mark Zuckerberg oh-so-delicately suggested that iOS — iPhone's operating system — is looking a bit out-of-touch these days:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Instead of our phones being designed around apps first, what if we flip that around? What if our phones were designed around people first?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, Home's&nbsp;innovative system-wide presentation and highly visual user experience may even serve as a guide to <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/pr/bios/jonathan-ive.html\" target=\"_blank\">Apple design guru</a>&nbsp;Jonathan Ive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Facebook Home effectively takes over a device's lock screen, populating it in real-time with the user's Newsfeed, photo stream and Facebook-sanctioned notifications. Updates from the user's Facebook contacts, or a Facebook message, for example, are revealed instantly no matter what app is active through the clever use of \"chat heads.\"</p>
<p>Chat heads also supports texting and messaging from within another (non-Facebook) app. Facebook Home's notifications include the individual's profile picture and can be displayed in a card-like fashion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are visually appealing features which are not available in the iPhone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's Zuckerberg belaboring the point yesterday:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We're not building a phone, and we're not building an OS — we're building an experience that's deeper than any other app.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Apple Is Playing Catch-Up</h2>
<p>You have to assume that Ive and Apple's iOS design team are poring over every detail Zuckerberg and company revealed yesterday.&nbsp;Earlier this week, Apple bloggers&nbsp;such as Mark Gurman, M.G. Siegler, Rene Richie and John Gruber discussed <a href=\"http://branch.com/b/apple-to-begin-iphone-production-this-quarter\" target=\"_blank\">ways Apple might update iOS</a>&nbsp;on the discussion site Branch.&nbsp;Consider these snippets from their public conversation:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Apple should use WWDC to introduce and explain new functionality... and improve iOS inter-app communication. Admit that some things sucked/sucks.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>(Design chief Jony) Ive's work is apparently making many people really happy, but will also apparently make rich-texture-loving designers sad.</em></p>
<p><em>Ive getting his hands on the UI might alter the consumer-facing bullet points, but probably not the API's that were planned.</em></p>
<p><em>Ive is pushing a more “flat design” that is starker and simpler, according to developers who have spoken to Apple employees but didn’t have further details. Overall, they expect any changes to be pretty conservative.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is clearly an opportunity for Apple to maintain its closed platform while still supporting greater inter-app communications, more robust developer access to the lock-screen, multi-modal personal communications, and the effective integration of data and contacts across apps, just like Home.</p>
<p>While iPhone hardware has clearly evolved, a 2008 iPhone user would feel immediately at home with iOS in 2013. There is good in such stability - and it is a testament to how much Apple got right, and how far ahead of the competition it was upon launch. However, as our smartphones do more and play a larger role in people's lives, Apple cannot stand still - nor be perceived as standing still.</p>

<p class=\"p1\">Cloud Computing is so hot right now that the cloud pretenders are crawling out of the woodwork. You don't have to look very far to find consultants who know nothing and \"cloud services\" that consist of little more than tacking the word \"cloud\" onto an otherwise ordinary service.</p>
<p class=\"p1\">Ironically, though, some of cloud computing's biggest issues come from the paragon of the technology: Amazon. For the past several years <a href=\"http://readwrite.com/2013/01/14/amazon-web-services-can-it-win-the-enterprise\">Amazon Web Services (AWS)</a> has been synonymous with cloud computing in the startup world. Startup CEOs hand Amazon their credit cards as a \"checkbox item\" - just like our grandparents called Bell Telephone when they needed a phone.</p>
<p class=\"p1\">But times are changing. <a href=\"http://www.indexventures.com/team/index/profile_id/5\">Danny Rimer of Index Ventures</a> recently commented on how <a href=\"http://pandodaily.com/2013/03/07/danny-rimers-investment-thesis-clouds-the-whole-way-down/\">Amazon is losing its grip on the cloud computing space</a>, even as cloud computing continues its massive growth.</p>
<p class=\"p1\"><strong>(See also <a href=\"http://readwrite.com/2013/03/19/amazon-king-of-cloud-computing-forever\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon: Can It Stay King Of Cloud Computing Forever?</a>)</strong></p>
<h2 class=\"p2\">Amazon And The Promise Of Cloud Computing</h2>
<p class=\"p1\">Is Amazon moving away from cloud computing's core values? The promise of cloud computing lies not only in its technology but in its pricing and packaging structure. The idea is pretty simple: pay for the compute power you use. If you need more, you buy more. If you need less, you buy less.</p>
<p class=\"p1\">This is in obvious contrast to past models in which you buy hardware for your on-premise data center or your colocated space, then live within whatever means you own. That capital expense was slow to react to shifts in demand and put you at risk of over- or under-capacity. Hourly billing freed us from that - most users saw a clear progession toward per minute billing to even more closely match the demand curve.</p>
<p class=\"p1\">Why, then, when you use an Amazon server for 62 minutes do you still get charged for 120 minutes? Multiply that by a couple hundred servers over a year and the difference adds up. How come AWS gives its best prices only with 1-3 year contracts, with up front fees? That sure seems a lot like that step-wise CAPEX spend cloud was supposed to avoid.</p>
<p class=\"p1\">AWS’s pricing page includes several terms that seem anti-cloud, for example:</p>
<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"embedded-Media-image img-caption-c\">
				<img src=\"http://readwrite.com/files/awscontract.png\" style=\"\" />
			</span>
</p>
<h2 class=\"p2\">It's A Technology Issue</h2>
<p class=\"p1\">If you look at the technology stack, things haven’t progressed much in the last 5 years there either. Have you ever wondered why you get offered <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/\">stock sizes that Amazon selects for you</a> instead of the exact CPU, RAM and block storage you want?</p>
<p class=\"p1\">Because AWS uses Ethernet-based networks, once a virtual machine has been provisioned on physical hardware, it’s stuck there until you turn it off. That's why Amazon users occassionally get emails asking them to turn off their virtual machines.</p>
<p class=\"p1\">As Amazon plays a Tetris-like game of fitting VMs on hardware, you end up paying for capacity you didn’t want just to make Amazon’s life simpler.</p>
<p class=\"p1\">There’s got to be a better way, right? Cloud Computing 2.0 providers are built on technologies like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InfiniBand\">InfiniBand</a>, that allow for 80-gigabit speeds within the network - making it easier to separate CPU cores, RAM and storage to provide infinite options. It also allows a similar flexibility in billing.</p>
<p class=\"p1\">That can make a big difference. <a href=\"https://cloudability.com/\">Cloudability</a>, says the 100 companies it surveyed waste 40% of their Amazon spend buying too many resources.</p>
<p class=\"p1\">Cloud computing is supposed to let you buy your core setup and then become elastic, expanding as you need it and contracting when you don't. If you need computing power for 65 minutes you should pay for 65 minutes. If you need it for three hours, you should pay for three hours. That's the way we can truly achieve the promise the cloud offers.</p>

We even <a href=\"http://readwrite.com/2013/04/01/the-facebook-phone-the-triumph-of-native-apps-over-html5\">said so</a> right here on ReadWrite. After all, Facebook apparently likes native more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, CIOs missed the memo, and the dirty little secret is that most of the world's software, including apps, is written for use, not sale. That means that most of the world's software is not going to follow what Facebook's mobile strategy is, but rather what those stodgy enterprises do.</p>
<p>Those stodgy enterprises? They're all in on HTML5.</p>
<p>I spent Wednesday afternoon with a who's who of enterprise CIOs and CTOs in New York City, talking about Big Data, cloud and mobile. With the Facebook Phone in mind, I polled the group on its mobile applications. Every single executive - not one exception - was building hybrid HTML5 apps, meaning the bulk of the app is written in HTML5 with a native wrapper to improve performance, add camera access, etc.</p>
<p>Every. Single. One.</p>
<p>And not just a few such apps. The bulk of their apps were hybrid HTML5 apps, both for internal employees and for external customers.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Going Native?</h2>
<p>Sure, there were some native apps, though generally not yet written for Android. (\"We can't figure out what to do about Android,\" said one executive of a major financial services firm.) But overall, the CIOs I talked to, and there were roughly 100 in the room, were basing their mobile app strategy on hybrid HTML5 apps.</p>
<p>The CIO needs are different from Zynga's, or those of other consumer app developers. Many of the apps they're building are informational in nature, or have such a stringent need for broad access that these enterprises simply can't afford to alienate a particular mobile device demographic. They need to support iOS, Android, Windows, Blackberry, etc. And with the vast majority of mobile OSes now sporting HTML5-compatible browsers, the time is ripe for HTML5 apps.</p>
<h2>Still Hiring For HTML5</h2>
<p>The job numbers bear this out. While HTML5 can get pooh-poohed by consumer app developers like Facebook, it remains&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.indeed.com/jobtrends?q=HTML5%2Cios%2Candroid&amp;l=\">the hottest technology skill</a>, as measured by jobs, more than holding its own with iOS and Android in absolute number of jobs:</p>
<div style=\"width: 540px;\"><a title=\"HTML5,ios,android Job Trends\" href=\"http://www.indeed.com/jobtrends?q=HTML5%2Cios%2Candroid\"> <img src=\"http://www.indeed.com/trendgraph/jobgraph.png?q=HTML5%2Cios%2Candroid\" alt=\"HTML5,ios,android Job Trends graph\" width=\"540\" height=\"300\" border=\"0\" /> </a></div>
<p>And trouncing both iOS and Android in terms of relative job growth:</p>
<div style=\"width: 540px;\"><a title=\"HTML5,ios,android Job Trends\" href=\"http://www.indeed.com/jobtrends?q=HTML5%2Cios%2Candroid&amp;relative=1&amp;relative=1\"> <img src=\"http://www.indeed.com/trendgraph/jobgraph.png?q=HTML5%2Cios%2Candroid&amp;relative=1\" alt=\"HTML5,ios,android Job Trends graph\" width=\"540\" height=\"300\" border=\"0\" /> </a></div>
<p>This corroborates <a href=\"http://www.evansdata.com/press/viewRelease.php?pressID=185\">Evans Data's finding in early 2012</a> that 75% of mobile developers were using or expecting to use HTML5, a number that seems to have moved from aspirational to actual in 2013.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hence, while the media will tend to focus on what it knows best - consumer apps - CIOs are working away on HTML5 strategies. Just <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/ciocentral/2013/01/23/html5-vs-native-mobile-apps-myths-and-misconceptions/\">ask Accenture</a>. Yes, there are <a href=\"http://css.dzone.com/articles/building-mobile-applications\">tradeoffs when going HTML5</a>, just as there are tradeoffs when going native. For enterprise CIOs, however, broad, cross-platform access to employees and customers makes HTML5 a winning solution.</p>

Microsoft Cloud War [Infographic]") (description nil "<p>Microsoft is gunning for the online productivity tools user base in a big way, marketing Exchange Online in an effort to take on Gmail. So, how do these two platforms compare?</p>
<p>If you're looking at uptime, which is a pretty big number for any cloud-based system, the <a title=\"http://googleenterprise.blogspot.com/2013/04/pure-and-proven-cloud-gmail.html\" href=\"http://googleenterprise.blogspot.com/2013/04/pure-and-proven-cloud-gmail.html\">Google Enterprise team reported earlier this week</a> that their actual Gmail uptime percentage for 2012 was 99.983% - better than Google's guaranteed 99.9% rate.</p>
<p>\"This translates to an average of just over seven minutes of service disruption per month over the last year, and most users experienced no disruption at all,\" Venkat Panchapakesan, Vice President of Engineering reported.</p>
<p>Curious to see how Microsoft compared, the folks at <a title=\"http://www.cloudsherpas.com\" href=\"http://www.cloudsherpas.com\">Cloud Sherpas</a> decided to analyze 151 days of Exchange Online incident reports to get Microsoft's uptime percentage. Their <a title=\"http://blog.cloudsherpas.com/hot-topics/google-apps-vs-office-365-a-comparison-of-gmail-and-exchange-system-availability/\" href=\"http://blog.cloudsherpas.com/hot-topics/google-apps-vs-office-365-a-comparison-of-gmail-and-exchange-system-availability/\">figures were notable</a>: in that measured period, Exchange Online had a 97.929% uptime rate, lower than Microsoft's 99.9% uptime promise.</p>
<p>There are, I would say, a couple of big caveats with this report: first, Cloud Sherpas seems to equate Gmail vs. Exchange stats as a Google Apps vs. Office 365 face off. The last I heard, Gmail was only one part of Google Apps, and Exchange a component of Office 365. Downtime for one does not reflect downtime for all.</p>
<p>Plus, the figures could be cherry picked a bit: Exchange Online was monitored from Sept. 23, 2012 to February 2, 2013, and the reported Gmail figures are from the entire 2012 calendar year, not just the same 151-day timeframe. For all we know, Exchange Online was problem free for all of 2012 until September 22. Or, after January 1 of this year, Gmail tanked a few times.</p>
<p>Google and Microsoft (and their respective proxies) will no doubt be butting heads in this space for quite some time. What is interesting to me are the anecdotal reports I keep hearing from workplaces that have shifted to Google Apps: people love to use Google Apps for collaboration and shared storage, but when documents are actually being created, Microsoft Office is still the tool of choice.</p>
<p>There are no clear winners yet in this space, but for now, there is no getting around the fact that Exchange Online was only up 97.929% for almost half a year, which comes out to just over three days of lost productivity. The infographic below tells Cloud Sherpas' story:</p>

In the past week, senior Microsoft executives have joined disruptive challengers in the mobile and cloud markets, suggesting that Microsoft's brainpower isn't lacking, even if its market share is.</p>
<p>The first executive departure was Charlie Kindel, the former Microsoft executive who managed developer outreach for Windows Phone, who actually left Microsoft nearly two years ago but just now found his way to Amazon. While it's still anyone's guess as to what Kindel will be doing at Amazon - given his past role with Windows Phone, some are <a href=\"http://www.digitalspy.com/tech/news/a469923/kindle-phone-speculation-mounts-as-windows-phone-boss-joins-amazon.html\">mooting</a> the possibility that he will be helping build out an Amazon phone - this is becoming a bit of a habit for Windows Phone executives to leave for Amazon.</p>
<p>After all, just last year Brandon Watson, also from the Windows Phone developer outreach team, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2012/02/05/windows-phone-exec-brandon-watson-leaves-microsoft-headed-to-am/\">left for Amazon</a>. In his case, Watson joined Amazon to help on the Kindle cross-platform team.</p>
<p>Nor is it just the Windows Phone team that has been leaking.</p>
<p>Today <a href=\"http://investors.redhat.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=753669\">Red Hat announced</a> that it had snagged&nbsp;Radhesh Balakrishnan, Microsoft's Azure chief for Asia-Pacific, to run its virtualization efforts, including OpenShift, Red Hat's open-source PaaS offering. If Red Hat were to borrow from any competitor to steal a march on VMware in the virtualization market, or Amazon in the cloud market, Microsoft was a great place to look.</p>
<p>After all, Microsoft has been <a href=\"http://up2v.nl/2012/07/11/happy-birthday-vmware-welcome-windows-server-2012/\">cutting into VMware's virtualization market share for years</a>, and Azure has become a solid #2 to Amazon, as a recent Forrester survey indicates:</p>
<p><span class=\"embedded-Media-image img-caption-c\">
				<img src=\"http://readwrite.com/files/amazon_vs_azure.jpg\" style=\"\" />
			</span>
</p>
<p>One way to look at this is that Microsoft is hemorrhaging talent and <strong>must</strong> be a sinking ship. But I think this would be an incorrect reading.&nbsp;After all, though Microsoft is late to both the cloud and mobile parties, it's making progress in both, and continues to <a style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\" href=\"http://readwrite.com/2013/02/18/microsofts-mobile-ambition-not-dead-yet#feed=/author/matt-asay\">own the affections of CIOs</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No, I think the better interpretation is that for all Microsoft's execution issues, it continues to have a bevy of super-smart employees. Amazon and Red Hat certainly seem to think so.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And for every Microsoft executive that leaves, there are many more who are choosing to stay. If anything, these departures say little about Microsoft's fortunes and instead simply indicate that Amazon and Red Hat may offer exciting options of their own. While it's tempting to assume that executive departures are a clear sign of a company's struggles, reading the tea leaves in this way would put <a href=\"http://www.csmonitor.com/Innovation/Horizons/2012/1031/At-Apple-two-high-profile-executive-departures\">Apple</a>, <a href=\"http://venturebeat.com/2012/08/02/with-stock-price-at-low-facebook-loses-3-more-executives/\">Facebook</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303754904577531230541447956.html\">Google</a>, among others, in serious jeopardy.</p>
<p>Most people would love to have that kind of \"jeopardy.\"</p>

From Larry Ellison, island-owning-cutthroat-businessman-billionaire, to Mark Zuckerberg, billionaire-coder-CEO-visionary, the once-lowly nerd — with Silicon Valley serving as his Xanadu — is now creator of much of the world's riches, seer of the world's future, and the person to whom Presidents and hopefuls come for money, anointing and benificent manipulation of Big Data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was not always thus.</p>
<p>Even while Bill Gates was destroying the competition in his fast march to world's richest human being, nerds in high schools around the world were still getting bullied.&nbsp;The rise of the web, PCs, social media and easy money — all easily leveraged by the nerd — have at last taught even the biggest, meanest, stupidest of bullies, that the nerd they pick on today may very well be the one that creates that thing that puts the bully's future self out of work, and possibly eradicates the only industry he's ever known.</p>
<p>To its credit, Hollywood has long promoted the glory and power — and humanness — of the nerd, since at least the dawn of the Reagan Era. Long before nearly anyone, including nerds, actually owned a computer, Hollywood revealed a potential, brainy hero figure.</p>
<p>True, while many movies still offer up the stereotypical nerd, slovenly, socially inept, living in mom's basement, spending his (always his) nights staring into banks of computer monitors, and lacking even the fortitude to be the hero's plucky sidekick, some of the best films of the past 30 years have glorified the nerd.</p>
<p>These are the very best of the bunch.</p>
<h2>Revenge of the Nerds</h2>
<p>Released nearly 30 years ago, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088000/?ref_=sr_1\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Revenge of the Nerds</em></a>&nbsp;is the standard by which all nerdy cinema will forevermore be judged against.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adams College freshman nerds Gilbert and Lewis are relentlessly taunted by the jocks of Alpha Beta fraternity. When the jocks force the nerds out of their dorm, the nerds must create their own fraternity — and teach the entire school why nerds matter.&nbsp;Booger and Pointdexter nearly steal the show.&nbsp;</p>
<p><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/Hw6zrInbtQE\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Real Genius</h2>
<p>It was \"Morning in America\" and Hollywood was moving at warp speed to release pro-nerd films. One of the nerdiest ever was <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089886/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Real Genius</em></a>, the story of a boy and another boy, and mostly only boys, except for the rare girl, who were all so super-smart that they were sent off to a sort of Cal Tech Junior High.</p>
<p>Our anti-hero, Mitch, so smart that even his parents don't know what to do with him, helps save the world, gets the girl and learns that the smarter you are the less you <em>need to care</em> about your appearance. Brain power trumps all.&nbsp;</p>
<p><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/FF3pxBRAI0k\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"></iframe>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>WarGames</h2>
<p>Phone Phreaking in 1983, the fallacy of the Cold War, computer hacking, computer gaming — probably no mainstream Hollywood film has ever been as audacious as <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086567/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1\" target=\"_blank\"><em>WarGames</em></a> in its depiction of the power of the nerd. All Matthew Broderick's character wants to do is hack phone systems and play the latest and greatest computer games. Instead, he nearly starts World War III.&nbsp;</p>
<p><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/tAcEzhQ7oqA\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>American Splendor</h2>
<p>If Matthew Broderick's nerd helped avert World War III in WarGames, then twenty years later, following the PC revolution, the Internet revolution, and the bursting of the Internet stock bubble, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0305206/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1\" target=\"_blank\"><em>American Splendor</em></a> offered a smaller, more cynical view of the nerd. The film's depiction of the slovenly, obsessive, radically under-employed&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\">Harvey Pekar&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\">delivered a vision of the nerd as common man. </span></p>
<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\">Only, in this case, one bursting with talent and, if he must admit it, reasonably happy with his meager lot in life. Hoarder Harvey decides to document his life in comic form and it becomes wildly popular — primarily due to its unflinching honesty.&nbsp;The film also offers a brief but inspired depiction of comic artist and uber-nerd, Robert Crumb.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/g19nAE_ihp0\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>X-Men</h2>
<p><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120903/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl\" target=\"_blank\"><em>X-Men</em></a>&nbsp;may be the prototypical Hollywood vision of the nerd. Nerds are, well, born that way. They are endowed with amazing abilities, which makes them stand out from everyone else. X-Men also has,&nbsp;surprisingly, one of the best Nazi prison camp scenes of any film from any genre. Only, it's not about Nazis or the past, but the future — and who will control it.</p>
<p>This being a Hollywood blockbuster, all those born with the special \"X gene\" are, not surprisingly, equally pretty and badass. &nbsp;</p>

(description nil "<p>Good news: If you're running a local crime syndicate from your iPhone, the authorities are going to have a hard time reading your texts. That's because, as <a href=\"http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-57577887-38/apples-imessage-encryption-trips-up-feds-surveillance/\" target=\"_blank\">the DEA recently complained</a>, the company's iMessage protocol is encrypted end-to-end, which prevents law enforcement from spying on users' messages, even with a court order.</p>
<p>This is good news for iOS-loving drug lords, but, more importantly, it's a big win for digital privacy. And from Apple, no less.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With government requests for personal data on the rise, there are few guarantees in place that you or I won't have our private communications snooped through. Since the Fourth Amendment hasn't yet caught up with the lightning fast pace of technological change, some of the best privacy protections are often the ones implemented by tech companies themselves.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>A Rare Privacy Win For Apple&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Apple isn't exactly known as a champion of consumer privacy. It's not reckless either, but few people expect the company to defend users' privacy any more than they the law or consumer sentiment requires.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For a company like Twitter, it's different. Principles like user privacy and free speech have become important enough to the service's core functionality that the company has no choice but to value and protect them. As a result, Twitter <a style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\" href=\"https://www.eff.org/pages/when-government-comes-knocking-who-has-your-back\" target=\"_blank\">gets pretty high marks</a> from privacy advocates.</p>
<p>Even Google, which has had its share of privacy snafus, is pretty good at being transparent and safeguarding its users' privacy generally. Apple? It's as mindful about privacy as it needs to be, but it's not a chief motivator for the company.</p>
<p>By architecting iMessage the way it did, Apple created a messaging protocol more secure and private than standard text messages, which is how millions of people communicate every day. As we fire those texts back and forth, we're all creating a digital trail that can be snooped upon or hacked more easily than we care to think about. But if they're being and sent and received from iPhones running iOS 5 or later, those messages are invisible to wiretaps by law enforcement or other prying eyes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apple didn't have to build iMessage with end-to-end encryption. Gmail isn't encrypted this way, nor are the Facebook messages that are increasingly used like texts on mobile devices. Clearly, SMS text messages aren't particularly well-secured either. Whether winning privacy points was its motivation or not, Apple definitely racks up a few for this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, Apple has had its own share of privacy controversies. <a href=\"http://readwrite.com/2011/04/20/your_iphone_is_tracking_your_every_move\">Locationgate</a> and <a href=\"http://readwrite.com/2011/12/01/its_carrier_iqs_world_we_just_live_in_it\">Carrier IQ</a> come to mind. Then there was <a href=\"http://gizmodo.com/5880593/the-apple-bug-that-let-us-spy-on-a-total-strangers-iphone\" target=\"_blank\">the iMessage bug</a> that accidentally exposed some users' private messages, an embarrassing screwup was fixed in iOS 6. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Critics were rightfully quick to pounce on Apple for those things, but we need to be every bit as eager to applaud big tech companies when they get it right.</p><div class=\"feedflare\">

The tech press had two immediate reactions to the news, both of them wrong.</p>
<p>Some greeted the news with sadness and longing.&nbsp;Per <a style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\" href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/03/disney-shuts-down-lucasarts-just-154-days-after-acquiring-it/\" target=\"_blank\">TechCrunch</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While the move was not unforeseen (the company’s last few games haven’t been very successful, and rumors of projects being shuttered have trickled in since the acquisition), that doesn’t make today’s news any less disheartening. A part of my childhood — a part of an entire generation of gamer’s collective childhood, really — goes down with LucasArts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From <a href=\"http://news.cnet.com/8301-10797_3-57577786-235/disney-shuttering-lucasarts-moving-to-licensed-games-model/\" target=\"_blank\">CNET</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>\"So, first, Disney cancels the 'Clone Wars,' the best thing to happen to 'Star Wars' since the original trilogy, and now this,\" wrote a commenter on a Kotaku story on the shut-down. \"I am now extremely skeptical of Disney's handling of this company, and I fear [for] the franchise's future.\"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For others, the move was new evidence of the gaming shift from consoles to smartphones, as <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/gamelife/2013/04/lucasarts-disney/\" target=\"_blank\">Wired supposed</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s hard to be surprised at this turn of events when Disney spelled it all out at the time of the acquisition. It’s moving away from internally-developed console games, having shut down Warren Spector’s studio Junction Point following the release of Epic Mickey 2, and towards social and mobile.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the real reason for Disney's shuttering of LucasArts was foretold many years ago in that cinematic classic <em><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094012/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1\" target=\"_blank\">Spaceballs</a></em>: \"Merchandising. Merchandising. Merchandising.\"</p>
<p>Merchandising, as the wise Yogurt tells us, is \"where the real money from the movie is made.\"</p>
<p><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/oNZove4OTtI\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"560\" height=\"420\"></iframe></p>
<p>Consider the official Lucasfilm statement regarding the closing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After evaluating our position in the games market, we’ve decided to shift LucasArts from an internal development to a licensing model, minimizing the company’s risk while achieving a broader portfolio of quality Star Wars games.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's hard to view that statement, and the prominent use of the phrase \"licensing model,\" as meaning anything but this: Disney's Star Wars team is looking forward to revenues, but backwards for, well... for \"content.\"</p>
<h2>It's All About Content. Star Wars Content</h2>
<p>This is not cynical, just (big) business. Business — and Disney is the master of the \"content\" business — is what this acquisition was about, after all. Disney bought content, pure and simple — great big barrels of Star Wars content with which to fill its merchandising channels and theme park attractions and all that vast empty space on the Disney Channel.</p>
<p>Just think of it — all those great concepts like the Death Star, lightsabers and pod racing, and characters such as Luke and Leia, R2D2 and that robot that had the bad cough, all pureed and processed and poured out into any number of new money-making ventures. That's what Disney was buying when it paid for the highly immersive Star Wars universe.</p>
<p>In the Disney calculation, LucasArts was little more than a distraction, if that. The Disney machine already includes a gaming division, an animation studio, and plenty of skilled people already on staff.</p>
<p>Likewise, Disney almost certainly never even considered the proposed <em style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\">Star Wars 1313</em> video game shooter, and probably never thought much — if at all — about many of the division's great legacy games. Even if they produced memorable scenes or characters, these games&nbsp;touch very few people. Disney covets blockbusters — which, of course, are then ground up and forced through all of Disney's many channels.</p>
<h2>The Future According To Disney</h2>
<p>So expect not just a new Star Wars trilogy but a cavalcade of Disney World-Star Wars thrill rides. Assume there will be a Star Wars \"Experience\" at Disneyland. Your daughter will be singing catchy Star Wars-esque tunes she's already heard a million times on the Disney Channel. At night, you'll read your young son one of the many age-appropriate Star Wars books.</p>
<p>New toys, action figures, games — based solely on the original Star Wars blockbusters and the hoped-for blockbusters of the future — will probably sell in the billions. The characters in <em>Toy Story 4</em> will lovingly mock their new friend, the bumbling Jar Jar Binks. Your grandchildren will grow up believing Jango Fett is a spaceman-like Billy the Kid, delivering outlaw justice throughout the furthest corners of the galaxy.</p>
<p>LucasArts was never going to be a part of this grand Disney vision.&nbsp;All you can hope for now is that whatever Disney creates based on their total ownership of the Star Wars universe does not suck.</p>

It's far more than just an app and beyond just a skin, but something less than an operating system. It doesn't replace Android or skins like TouchWiz, but installing it will radically transform your Android phone — and not necessarily for the better.</p>
<p>What Home boils down to is this: if you're obsessed with Facebook, Home is for you. But if you'd like to use your Android phone for something else — like checking email, for example — you'll probably find Home more trouble than it's worth.</p>
<p><a style=\"text-decoration: underline;\" href=\"http://readwrite.com/2013/04/04/facebooks-android-home-event-livestream#_tid=hub-hero&amp;_tact=click+%3A+A&amp;_tval=1&amp;_tlbl=Position%3A+1\" target=\"_self\">Facebook launched Home at a press event</a>&nbsp;on Thursday. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, described it as a way to redesign the phone for \"people first,\" rather than the apps that dominate the rest of the smartphone universe.</p>
<p>If you'd like to try out Home, you have two options: wait until April 12 and download it from Google Play, or buy the HTC First for $99, the first phone with Home embedded within it. If you choose to download, be aware that Home will only run on the HTC One X, HTC One X+, Samsung's Galaxy S3 and Note 2, and the forthcoming HTC One and Galaxy S4, Facebook said.</p>
<p><span class=\"embedded-Media-image img-caption-c\">
				<img src=\"http://readwrite.com/files/IMG_20130404_114304.jpg\" style=\"\" />
			</span>
</p>
<p>Facebook allowed the press to look at both the HTC First as well as phones running the Home software following the press event. While many weren't allowed to touch the phone, product managers encouraged me to play around with the downloadable Home app running on a Galaxy S3. I also tested the First, albeit briefly.</p>
<h2>Home Feels Like Home</h2>
<p>Home interjects itself from the first moment you pick up your phone. On the unlock screen, Home displays the first entry in what Facebook calls its Cover Feed: full-screen, vertically-oriented photos with text from a status message overlaid. Swiping left and right brings up new entries.</p>
<p>You can think of Cover Feed as an Instapaper-like view of your News Feed, emphasizing photos and status messages. You won't see video, group posts, or even ads — yet. But Facebook promises almost monthly updates, so plan on additional features to be added in the future. Who wants to bet that ads will one day be one of those additions?</p>
<p><span class=\"embedded-Media-image img-caption-c\">
				<img src=\"http://readwrite.com/files/IMG_20130404_114718.jpg\" style=\"\" />
				<span class=\"embedded-Media-image-caption\">Hey! Apps! Nope, they&#039;re shortcuts.</span>
		</span>
</p>
<p>Clearly, this \"home\" slice of \"Home\" is the easiest to use, and the most enjoyable. Even if you have a just a few seconds, you can quickly swipe left and right to bring up new updates, double-tap an image to Like it, and add a comment by clicking the icon at the bottom of the screen. Sliding from image to image was effortless, at least on both the First and the Note II.</p>
<p>Note that this is Facebook's domain: there are no widgets, no app shortcuts, and no Google search bar at the top of the screen. If you want those, you'll have to work for it.</p>
<p>Home also displays a small, circular icon at the bottom of the screen with an image of your face inside it, as a starting point for further navigation. If you want to launch a Web browser, swipe right; swipe left to launch Facebook Messenger, and swipe up to access your \"apps\".</p>
<p>Swiping right brings up the stock Web browser — no problems there. Swiping left brings up Messenger, where you can text and message your friends. If you're on a cellular connection, those Messages will be sent via SMS, which highlights them in blue. (Or so the product-demo person at the event told me. No, I don't see why it couldn't send Facebook messages via cellular data, either.)</p>
<p>But Facebook Home also includes both notifications and something called \"Chat Heads,\" which can follow you from app to app. If you happen to be listening to Spotify, for example, and your friend pings you, their \"head\" — a circular icon with their picture — shows up and you can begin chatting. You can engage in multiple conversations with different friends via different \"tabs,\" each keyed to a chat head.</p>
<p><span class=\"embedded-Media-image img-caption-c\">
				<img src=\"http://readwrite.com/files/IMG_20130404_114415.jpg\" style=\"\" />
				<span class=\"embedded-Media-image-caption\">Messenger looks the same.</span>
		</span>
</p>
<p>Home also sends you notifications for friends who Like your posts, which will pop up on your screen. Home has a nifty trick for dismissing them all at once: just hold down your finger on the screen, and they'll converge like hungry fish. They then can be \"thrown\" off of the screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class=\"embedded-Media-image img-caption-c\">
				<img src=\"http://readwrite.com/files/Chat%20heads.jpeg\" style=\"\" />
				<span class=\"embedded-Media-image-caption\">&quot;Chat Heads&quot;</span>
		</span>
</p>
<p>I suppose some may be nonplussed by chat and notification icons popping up randomly, but most Facebook addicts will probably love these features. It's when you bring apps into the equation that things get a little awkward.</p>
<h2>You Can Log Off, But You Can (Almost) Never Leave</h2>
<p>Why? Because accessing other apps implies that you want to look away from Facebook. Facebook doesn't want you to leave; part of the value Facebook ascribes to itself is its engagement with the user. When you swipe up to access apps, you don't really access \"apps\" — a small window of \"shortcuts\" to the apps themselves appear. And at the top of the window is the familiar \"status\" and \"photo\" shortcuts.</p>
<p>In other words, you haven't actually left Home; you're just in its antechamber.</p>
<p>Home does allow you to access your full list of apps, arranged alphabetically. At the very bottom is a \"More\" icon. Clicking that takes you back to your home screen — except this time, you're within the Android/TouchWiz/HTC Sense environment. Congratulations — you've escaped.</p>
<p>As you might have figured out, Home wants to monopolize your attention, so that any other function your phone wishes to perform — such as notifying you of an email, for example — gets treated as an intrusion.</p>
<p><span class=\"embedded-Media-image img-caption-c\">

&nbsp;</p>
<h2>No E-Mail For You!</h2>
<p>This is where experience on phones like the HTC First diverge from phones built around the Home app. The First notifies users of incoming emails (or Google Talk requests, as I saw) via notifications. On a phone which uses a Home app, the Android status bar at the top of the screen does the same thing, before being banished by Home. Functionally, it's almost the same thing. But inside Home, you tend to forget about the \"outside world\" of Android.</p>
<p>This, to me, feels like the \"catch\" of Facebook Home. Chief executive Mark Zuckerberg was asked whether he felt that Google would tolerate Home, since it essentially domnates the screen real estate that Google has traditionally regarded as its own.</p>
<p>It's \"theoretically possible,\" Zuckerberg said, that Google would go back on its \"promise of openness\". Zuckerberg also described Apple as a partner, but iOS as a \"very controlled environment\" — the implication being that Home on top of iOS is a pipe dream.</p>
<p>Google representatives said that they consider Home to be a \"launcher,\" a way of recasting Google's Android. Does it bury Google content to the point that it's hidden? I think so. So far, it doesn't matter: “The Android platform has spurred the development of hundreds of different types of devices,\" Google said in a statement. \"This latest device demonstrates the openness and flexibility that has made Android so popular.”</p>
<p>But it's significant, I think, that Facebook has already shown that its mobile apps can be downloaded outside the Google Play store. If in fact Google tries to ban Facebook, Facebook may be able to pursue alternative means of distribution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should you download Home? Absolutely. You'll need to most recent updates to Facebook and Messenger to do so. But make sure that when you launch Home, you choose the option to run Home once, to try it out. Home will blow you away the first time you use it, but I think its appeal will wane for all but the most social users.</p><div class=\"feedflare\">

<h2 class=\"p2\">The Hype Was Heavy</h2>
<p class=\"p1\">Would it be new \"skin\" software designed to put Facebook front and center on any Android device? Or an actual device in of itself - the rumor mill suggested HTC - built from the ground up to feature the social networking giant. Or would it be something completely new and unexpected?</p>
<p class=\"p1\">Everyone wanted to know. Heck, the local newsradio station - not known for its tech savvy - gushed breathlessly about the event - right before talking about President Obama's visit to the Bay Area.</p>
<p class=\"p1\">But when Mark Zuckerberg walked on stage, it became clear we're talking about both! \"Today we're finally going to talk about the Facebook phone,\" Zuckerberg said. But that phone, the HTC First, is really just a reference model for the best integration of the Facebook Home software that can be downloaded onto any modern Android phone (starting April 12).</p>
<h2 class=\"p2\">What Is Facebook Home?</h2>
<p class=\"p1\">According to Zuckerberg, Facebook Home consists of a few key capabilities designed to put people, not apps, first. \"Today, our phones are designed aroundapps, not people\" Zuckerberg said. \"And we want to flip that around.\" He compared the change to adding Newsfeed to Facebook's website, where people started consuming about twice as much content overnight, he said. \"We want to bring this experience right to your phone, and deliver it to as many poeple as possible.\"</p>
<p class=\"p1\">There are three key components:&nbsp;Cover Feed, Chat Heads and Notifications.</p>
<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Cover Feed:</strong> Replacing the home and/or lock screen of an Android device, it gives you an immersive experience from the moment you turn on your phone, said Adam Mosseri, Facebook's director of product. Instead of seeing a clock and maybe a snippet of a notification, you see your Facebook Open Graph stories with large images cycling across the screen. News shares, status updates (use the poster's cover photo as the background) are visible right from the get got. You can do a long press to see the whole picture or swipe to get to the next one. You can even add comments right from the home screen, seen below.</p>
<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"embedded-Media-image img-caption-c\">
				<img src=\"http://readwrite.com/files/fb_cover_feed_0.jpg\" style=\"\" />
			</span>
</p>
<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Chat Heads:</strong> These little round bubbles with the images of your friends shown below are the metaphor for Facebook Home's way of keeping you up to date on what your friends are saying. Incorporating Facebook messaging and texting, you just tap on the Head to join the conversation. (Group conversations smuch all the participant's pictures into the bubble, slightly awkwardly.) The key here is that Chat Heads show up everywhere on the phone, not just in a dedicated app. They're always available - the little Heads show up in the corner of the screen no matter what else you're doing, and follow along when you move to a new app. (You can just flick them away if you want to get rid of them.)</p>
<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"embedded-Media-image img-caption-c\">
				<img src=\"http://readwrite.com/files/fb_chatheads.jpg\" style=\"\" />
			</span>
</p>
<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Notifications:</strong> If Chat Heads are about connecting to what's important to you, Zuckerberg said, Notifications are there to make sure you don't miss critical information - along with the name and face of the person who's sending you the message. Unfortunately, with the download version at least, Facebook Home will not support notifications of emails, but you can still use the native Android notification bar. It's not as pretty, but it's still effective - something may not matter to high-school kids, but it may to the older professionals who also make up a big part of Facebook's member base.</p>
<p class=\"p1\">Finally, Facebook Home adds a new app launcher, for when you still want to use your phone the old-fashioned way. Apps are really important too, so we wanted to make it just as easy to get to your apps. The app launcher is just one swipe away from your home or lock screen.</p>
<p class=\"p1\">Many, but not all, of these features can be switched on or off, the company said.</p>
<h2 class=\"p2\">How Big A Deal Is Facebook Home?</h2>
<p class=\"p1\">While Facebook home is not a complete mobile operating system, it's not some lightweight app, either. \"We're not building a phone, and we're not building an operating system, but we're also building something a lot deeper than just an app,\" Zuckerberg said. \"We wanted this to feel like system software, not just an app that your run. We feel like theres a higher bar for that…\"</p>
<p class=\"p1\">That's critical, because people spend <em>a lot</em> of time on Facebook on their mobile phones. Some 20% of the time people spend on their smartphones is spent with Facebook - 25% if you include Instragram, the company said. And that's three times as much as with any other app.</p>
<p class=\"p1\">Still, while Zuckerberg claimed that people look at Facebook 10-12 times a day, they look at the home screen of their phone <em>100 times</em> a day. Facebook Home brings the social network much closer to the user - and could be expected to seriously up Facebook's engagment time for those who use it.</p>
<p class=\"p1\">It also expands on Facebook's Mobile First mantra to what Zuckerberg called \"Mobile Best.\" \"We think this is the best version of Facebook there is.\"</p>
<h2 class=\"p2\">The Facebook Phone</h2>
<p class=\"p1\">Facebook Home will be available for free download from the Google Play store on April 12, but that's only part of the story. Facebook Home is also the HTC First (seen on the left, below), available the same day for $99.99 exclusively from AT&amp;T - pre-orders start today.</p>
<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"embedded-Media-image img-caption-c\">
				<img src=\"http://readwrite.com/files/photo-4.JPG\" style=\"\" />
			</span>
</p>
<p class=\"p1\">As the first phone with Facebook Home built in, the HTC First offers deeper integration than the downloadable version. The key, Zuckerberg said, is that users don't have to download anything or sign in to anything to get started. In addition, the built-in integration means Facebook Home can (unlike the downloadable version) incorporate notifications from other apps, such as email or Spotify. The email issue, particularly, will be a big deal to some people.</p>
<h2 class=\"p2\">What's Next For Facebook Home?</h2>
<p class=\"p1\">The April 12 launch date is only the beginning for Facebook Home. Zuckerberg promised that like all Facebook software, it will be updated monthly (not yearly like mobile operating systems). Updates will likely expand Cover Feed to include video, group joins, friending stories and other actions.</p>
<p class=\"p1\">Another thing to expect? Ads. While Zuckerberg said there would not be ads in Cover Feed at launch, he didn't dispute a question that they could be added at a later date.</p>
<p class=\"p1\">It also makes sense to expect more smartphones with Facebook Home built in. The company made no mention of an exclusive arrangement with HTC or AT&amp;T. The company also promised a tablet version of Facebook home within the next few months. As for a version of Facebook Home for the iPhone and iPad, Zuckerberg was non-committal. That will require working with Apple, he said, in ways that talking to Google wasn't necessary to do the Android version.</p>
<p class=\"p1\">And that could actually make some waves in the mobile platform wars. \"I actually think this is really good for Android,\" Zuckerberg said. Even though there are more Android phones out there, he explained, a lot of people do their best work on iphone first. \"This could bring more innovation to Android.\"</p>
<p class=\"p1\">Facebook will be working to lead that. \"This is a deeply technical problem, and its also a deeply social problem,\" Zuckerberg said, adding that his company is uniquely positioned to deal with that combination.</p>

(description nil "<p class=\"p1\">When it comes to video games, the death knell is rung loudly and frequently.&nbsp;In an industry so intrinsically tied to technological innovation, we won't stop hearing any time soon about what former trend or gaming mainstay has its head on the chopping block. The most recent forecast from worried gaming circles: original, story-driven, triple-A games are too bloated and risky to survive in a cheaper, stripped-down and more mobile world.&nbsp;Unfortunately,&nbsp;there's a lot of evidence backing this claim up.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"p1\">Case in point: <a href=\"http://www.bioshockinfinite.com/?RET=&amp;ag=true\" target=\"_blank\">BioShock Infinite</a>, which hit shelves on March 26 to universal acclaim. An artistic endeavor that cost anywhere between $100 to $200 million (<a href=\"http://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/the-cost-of-columbia-ken-levine-contradicts-claims-of-a-200-million-bioshock-infinite-budget/\">developer Irrational Games won't confirm</a>) to make and market on top of almost five years of development to fine tune it to near perfection, it's the second original installment in the BioShock series.</p>
<p class=\"p1\">But it's not a sequel. A game unto itself, it continues the trend of creator and writer Ken Levine's visions of thought-provoking period pieces. This one happens to mash a 1912 setting with pop-culture aesthetics, sensitive American history (<a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/2/4170256/bioshock-infinite-making-great-art-from-americas-racist-past-and\" target=\"_blank\">like racism and eugenics</a>) and moral philosophy into what is being called easily one of the greatest games ever made. In other words, while the first BioShock was a coming-of-age moment for video games as an art form back in 2007, Infinite can be viewed as the epitome of the modern, blockbuster <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_game\" target=\"_blank\">\"art game,\"</a> a term usually reserved for offbeat indie titles but one that aptly fits the murky, morality-infused waters that only BioShock treads.</p>
<p class=\"p1\">Despite all the accolades, BioShock Infinite might be the last of its kind. A number of factors are contributing to this outcome, but principally the struggle is between the money that can be made versus the amount of time, effort and studio dollars invested. Early sales reports from the United Kingdom say that despite the fever pitch engulfing the gaming community, <a href=\"http://www.digitalspy.com/gaming/news/a469845/bioshock-infinite-is-all-format-number-one-biggest-launch-of-series.html\" target=\"_blank\">BioShock Infinite still didn't outsell the new Tomb Raider at launch.</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"p1\">The gaming landscape is allowing independent developers to gain recognition easier and faster than ever before, mobile and Facebook games are generating more and more revenue, and a <a style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\" href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2013/03/28/ouya-hands-on/\" target=\"_blank\">$99 console has Kickstarted its way into the hands of consumers</a>. So&nbsp;there might not be a place for an artistically grand game with a $100 million plus budget, a $60 consumer price tag and a narrower target audience. Well, at least one that doesn't have a number tagged on the end of its name.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class=\"p1\">In The Next Console Generation, Sequels Will Sell</h2>
<p class=\"p1\">Of course, a handful of big-budget, triple-A games are slated for the end of the current generation of consoles this year. And 2014 and 2015 hold the promise of a slew of new games for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox 'Durango,' as its called at the moment.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"p1\">But a lot of these titles - and a healthy chunk of what <a href=\"http://www.polygon.com/2013/2/20/4008722/ps4-reveal-details\">Sony debuted at its PS4 event in February</a> - were sequels within established franchises that are only confirmed and shown off because publishers know they will sell.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"p1\">After all, your annual Call of Duty or Assassin's Creed take an international team of developers <a href=\"http://www.polygon.com/2013/4/2/4173590/assassins-creed-fans-will-tell-us-when-theyre-tired-of-annual\">only a year to churn out</a> and still make hundreds of millions of dollars in sales (Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 made $500 million in its first day, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/9683341/Call-of-duty-Black-Ops-II-sales-hit-500-million-in-first-24-hours.html\">making it the largest entertainment launch ever</a>).</p>
<p class=\"p1\">These games still cost tens of millions of dollars to make, but are offering increasingly less innovation with each iteration so the developers can put them on shelves every fall and keep turning those profits. However, to call BioShock a franchise - and Infinite a sequel - is to ignore its studio Irrational Games' mission, which is&nbsp;delivering&nbsp;unique, orginal, epic stories that constantly push the medium. <a href=\"http://www.polygon.com/game/bioshock-infinite/2779\" target=\"_blank\">Given the rave reviews</a>, the game pulls that off well.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"p1\">So it's not quite the case that BioShock Infinite will be the last \"art game\" as it is likely that it could be the last big-budget one. As the money begins to move away from console games in general, what's&nbsp;left for triple-A titles will naturally funnel to profitable franchises and not to unique, original gambles like BioShock.</p>
<p class=\"p1\">BioShock was such a gamble in fact that Levine, just to get the series off the ground last decade, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=Efv9Mgwk8SU\" target=\"_blank\">had to pitch&nbsp;the original for three years</a> before getting a publisher, Take-Two Interactive, to put some money behind it. That kind of attitude will become less and less common as the financial jaws begin to close in on console game publishing.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class=\"p1\">Follow The Money: Facebook And Mobile</h2>
<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"embedded-Media-image img-caption-c\">

			</span>
Hardcore gamers scoff at the shallowness of Angry Birds, the manipulative tactics of Facebook games, and the move towards a mobile-dominated industry offering smaller satisfactions. But the sad truth is that that's where the money is.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"p1\">Console sales are tanking. NPD Group reported last month that <a href=\"http://www.geekwire.com/2013/npd-video-game-sales-fall-25-percent-february/\" target=\"_blank\">console sales fell 36% in February</a> from the same time last year (though you could attribute some of that to consumers holding out for Sony and Microsoft's next generation), and Nintendo's&nbsp;<a href=\"http://allthingsd.com/20130315/wii-u-sales-still-lousy/\" target=\"_blank\">Wii U has been hurting of late</a>. As for game sales, those fell 25%.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"p1\"><strong>(See also:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://readwrite.com/2013/03/04/game-consoles-already-dead-developers-know-it#feed=/author/markhachman\" target=\"_blank\">Game Consoles Are Already Dead, And Developers Know It</a>)</strong></p>
<p class=\"p1\">Compare that to how Facebook game developers have been doing and you can start to see the shift. Makers of Facebook games like <a href=\"http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-57576361-93/facebook-game-developers-generated-$2.8-billion-in-2012/\" target=\"_blank\">Candy Crush generated a total of $2.8 billion in 2012 alone</a>. These are free games developed with the sole purpose of making you spend more time on Facebook and driving you, through addiction, to pony up more money than any traditional console game could ever milk out of you.</p>
<p class=\"p1\">As for mobile games, <a href=\"http://www.joystiq.com/2013/03/30/npd-digital-game-sales-growing-year-over-year-33-percent/\" target=\"_blank\">they generated $2.1 billion last year</a> and will keep growing alongside digitally sold titles and downloadable content. These are the new money makers, typically using a free model that sucks players dry&nbsp;like for instance Real Racing 3, described as <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/gamelife/2013/04/ea-mobile-real-racing-3/\" target=\"_blank\">\"F1 meets Farmville\"</a> because of its microtransaction system that forces you to pay every 30 minutes to keep playing.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"p1\">The final frontier to collapse into the gaming chasm is the indie community, which has undergone a bit of a transformation ever since the big hardware companies gained the ability to sell&nbsp;independently&nbsp;developed titles over their online marketplaces at prices as cheap as $5 and $10.</p>
<p class=\"p1\">The robust new market for quirky, well-designed games from small teams raises an interesting question:&nbsp;if indie games can provide a thought-provoking, philosophical and emotional interactive experience, what are we to lose in chopping off the&nbsp;triple-A limb if not simply scale and scope?</p>
<h2 class=\"p1\">The Indie Game Revolution&nbsp;</h2>
<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"embedded-Media-image img-caption-c\">
				<img src=\"http://readwrite.com/files/joruney.jpg\" style=\"\" />
			</span>
At this year's <a href=\"http://www.gdconf.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Game Developer's Conference</a> that took place in San Francisco last week, downloadable game Journey&nbsp;became the first independent title to win the Game of the Year award. That would be on top of the game's other multiple game&nbsp;of the year awards and its <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/gamelife/2012/12/video-games-grammys-journey/\" target=\"_blank\">Best Soundtrack Grammy nomination, a first for the medium</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"p1\">Journey has been hailed as <a href=\"http://www.gamesradar.com/why-journey-one-greatest-games-ever-made/\" target=\"_blank\">one of the greatest, most emotional storytelling experiences in modern gaming</a>, and yet it clocks in at about three hours of playtime and only costs $15 to download to your PS3. The concept is simple: play as an unnamed, cloaked figure that must travel to the peak of mountain. Yet it has a unique mechanism, as most indie games do, that allows you to join up with an anonymous player from anywhere in the world who can serendipitously enter your game at any time.</p>
<p class=\"p1\">This kind of thought-provoking take on gaming concepts is part of the canon of \"art games,\" a genre getting more and more recognition from mainstream markets. These titles are also fulfilling a need for deep, meaningful games in a world where the next BioShock Infinite is looking less and less likely. They're just doing it on a smaller scale and for less money.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"p1\">“Like it or not, we’re not the Clash anymore. We’re Green Day,\" said Andy Schatz, an indie game designer, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/01/arts/video-games/game-developers-conference-celebrates-indie-creators.html\" target=\"_blank\">in an interview with The New York Times' Chris Sullentrop</a>. A clever&nbsp;analogy&nbsp;and one that accurately describes the indie game market as it's evolved from fighting the traditional system to being embraced by it.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"p1\">This trend bodes well for the future of what was once a peripheral community that could barely get its creations on the market, but is also yet another reason why the industry may not sustain projects as bold and expensive as BioShock in the future.</p>
<h2 class=\"p1\">The Ground Is Shifting</h2>
<p>To deny there are artistic, big-budget games on the horizon would be to ignore the work of a handful of forward-thinking studios. Naughty Dog is producing<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcwNIPiGKc\" target=\"_blank\"> The Last of Us</a>, a post-apocalyptic game that puts you in the role of protecting a young girl amid vicious survival combat, and French studio Quantic Dream is making Beyond Two Souls, the first ever title to use full motion capture to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QZN2IC0vOo\" target=\"_blank\">transform an actress (Ellen Page, in this case) into a video game character</a> while keeping real-world likeness&nbsp;completely&nbsp;intact.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These games are doing what BioShock Infinite did: building off a previous success (Naughty Dog with its <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncharted\" target=\"_blank\">Uncharted series</a> and Quantic Dream with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_Rain\" target=\"_blank\">Heavy Rain</a>) and trying something new and envelope pushing. But in many ways they are also maneuvering the line between a bold step forward for the medium and something that still resembles a marketable blockbuster-style psychological thriller.</p>
<p>BioShock's appeal comes primarily from the way it feels like a complete realization of artistic vision, one painstakingly crafted over many years fraught with <a href=\"http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/175574/\" target=\"_blank\">uncertainty, revision and a number of high-profile employee departures</a>. It's a mix of ideas screaming to be translated into film, but likely will never get there because of <a href=\"http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-03-12-ken-levine-personally-killed-off-the-bioshock-film-heres-why\" target=\"_blank\">how impossible it would be</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"p1\">\"For all I know, I'll never get to work on another big $60 title - or the equivalent of that. Maybe there will be no economy for that. Who knows?\" Levine says to nonfiction author and game critic <a href=\"http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/9097228/tom-bissell-interviews-ken-levine-mind-bioshock\" target=\"_blank\">Tom Bissell in a Grantland interview</a>. \"…I'm pretty confident that talented people will be able to work on quality products. I just don't know exactly how.\" Admitting it's the 'how' that's up in the air is the first step. Figuring out what to do next is the&nbsp;important&nbsp;part.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"p1\">For those who have their hands on BioShock Infinite, and to the many who may likely pick it up in the near future, savor the game's moments and all that went into creating its floating city&nbsp;environment&nbsp;and the one-of-a-kind feel it evokes. It could be the last sign of a dying breed.&nbsp;</p>

") (description nil "<p>It's been five months since Timothy Ferriss <a href=\"http://readwrite.com/2012/11/29/is-bittorrent-the-future-of-book-publishing-tim-ferriss-is-banking-on-it\">launched his bold experiment</a> in modern publishing. The best-selling author bypassed the \"big six\" publishers, signed with Amazon and, as if that weren't unconventional enough, partnered with <a href=\"http://bittorrent.com\" target=\"_blank\">BitTorrent</a> to help promote his new book, <em>The 4-Hour Chef</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The whole thing seemed almost designed to generate press, which it did. But now for the important part: Did the experiment work?</p>
<p>It sure looks that way. Despite being boycotted by Barnes and Noble and other bricks and mortar retailers, Ferriss's book has sold over 250,000 copies and landed on all the major bestseller lists.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, Ferriss is a well-known and established author, which helps. So does signing with Amazon, which is powerful enough to send the U.S.'s biggest brick-and-mortar book retailer into a book-banning fury.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But as mighty as Amazon is, being banned from big-box retailers is a serious handicap. To compensate, Ferriss had to forge some unexpected partnerships, such as with smaller retailers and Panera Bread, the sandwich shop chain. He also teamed up with BitTorrent, through which he published a 680-megabyte bundle of bonus content, including behind-the-scenes videos, a sample chapter and author notes.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Can BitTorrent Actually Drive Sales?&nbsp;</h2>
<p>\"To be honest, I was initially skeptical about how many sales would result from BitTorrent,\" says Ferriss. &nbsp;\"After all, that's where people go to get stuff for free, right?\"</p>
<p>Indeed, most people associate the P2P filesharing protocol with pirating movies, music, software and yes, books. BitTorrent, Inc has been busy trying to shed that reputation, in part by partnering with well-known content creators like Ferriss, even if they're somewhat nervous about the idea.&nbsp;</p>
<p>\"It turns out that I couldn't have been more wrong,\" he says. \"The click-through rates from BitTorrent to Amazon were higher than anything I've ever seen through paid advertising. &nbsp;Orders of magnitude higher.\"</p>
<p>More than 880,000 people have clicked through to <em>The 4-Hour Chef</em>'s Amazon landing page. Amazon doesn't offer its authors conversion metrics, so it's hard to say how many of those people actually purchased the book. But it's an impressive amount of exposure. BitTorrent also sent nearly 300,000 people to the book's video trailer on YouTube and over 327,000 to Ferriss' website. Not bad.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Piracy Question&nbsp;</h2>
<p>But there's an elephant in the room: piracy. Just as easily as they can grab Ferriss' <em>4-Hour Chef</em> promotional bundle on BitTorrent, users can find pirated copies of all three of his books.&nbsp;</p>
<p>\"If someone is willing to spend time finding a legit bootleg source and reading a DRM-broken hard-to-read copy of my book on a computer screen not intended for reading, just to avoid spending $12 or so, they weren't ever my core audience to begin with,\" Ferriss says. \"If I get them, it's nothing but bonus points.\"</p>
<p>So, the Amazon/BitTorrent publishing hack seems to be working, for Ferriss at least. There are lessons to be learned here, but with the usual dose of caution. In the same way that Radiohead didn't single-handedly make \"pay what you want\" a viable model for all musicians, Ferriss's example is going to be of limited value to new authors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still, it demonstrates the potential of today's platforms and protocols when it comes to one-upping long-entrenched players and leveling the playing field a bit. We all can't be Tim Ferriss, just like <a href=\"http://readwrite.com/2013/04/02/justin-timberlake-proves-streaming-isnt-a-death-wish-for-music-sales\">we all can't be Justin Timberlake</a>. But just as the Internet has opened a new potential path to success for YouTube pop singers, platforms like Amazon and BitTorrent could be where tomorrow's authors find their audiences.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"feedflare\">

<p>Update: The event has ended. <a href=\"http://newsroom.fb.com/News/597/Introducing-Home\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook announced</a> both an application layer for Android with a variety of features as well as a smartphone called the HTC First, that will be available exclusively from AT&amp;T on April 12th for $99.99. Home will be available on select Android devices starting April 12th including the One X and One X+, Samsung Galaxy S3 and Galaxy Note II.

</p>
<p>Facebook Home is an application layer that is placed on top of Android. It is essentially a new user interface, also known as a \"skin\" in much the same way that HTC does Sense or Samsung does Touchwiz for Android.</p>
<p><span class=\"embedded-Media-image img-caption-c\">
				<img src=\"http://readwrite.com/files/fb_home_devices.jpg\" style=\"\" />
			</span>
</p>
<p>There are four main features to Facebook Home:</p>
<p><strong>Cover feed</strong> -- According to Facebook: \"Cover feed replaces the lock screen and home screen. It's a window into what's happening with your friends - friends finishing a bike race, your family sharing a meal or an article about your favorite sports team. These are the beautiful, immersive experiences that you get through Home.\"</p>
<p><strong>Chat heads</strong> -- \"With chat heads you can keep chatting with friends even when you're using other apps. When friends send you messages, a chat head appears with your friend's face, so you see exactly who you're chatting with. Messages reach you no matter what you're doing - whether you're checking email, browsing the web, or listening to music.\"</p>
<p><strong>Notifications</strong> -- \"Cover feed is great for seeing everything going on in the world. But when something happens that's more important and directed at you, like a friend posting on your timeline, you'll receive notifications with their profile pictures.&nbsp;To open notifications, just tap them. And if you don't want to deal with them right now, you can just swipe to hide them and keep flipping through cover feed until you want them back.\"</p>
<p><strong>Apps</strong> -- Facebook will have its own apps drawer, similar to iOS and Android.&nbsp;</p>

The stock price is way down, and the company apologizes at an unprecedented rate. Granted, Apple almost never apologizes for anything, and when it does, the apologies tend to be <a href=\"http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/09/29/isorry-a-history-of-apples-apologies\">less than apologetic</a>. So \"unprecedented\" simply means \"more than once per century\" - but this Apple is different.</p>
<p>For one thing, Apple just apologized for being, well, Apple.</p>
<h2>Apple's China Strategy Breaks New Ground</h2>
<p>In <a href=\"http://readwrite.com/2013/04/02/apple-apology-to-china-mission-accomplished\">Apple's apology to China</a> over allegedly shoddy customer support, Apple CEO Tim Cook said:</p>
<blockquote>We are aware that a lack of communications... led to the perception that Apple is arrogant and doesn't care or attach enough importance to consumer feedback. We express our sincere apologies for any concerns or misunderstandings this gave consumers.</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps Cook isn't aware, but nonchalance toward industry feedback and arrogance are hallmarks of Apple's history. Now it's apologizing for these traits? This from the company whose founder, Steve Jobs, famously said:</p>
<blockquote>Some people say, 'Give customers what they want.' But that's not my approach. Our job is to figure out what they're going to want before they do. I think Henry Ford once said, 'If I'd asked customers what they wanted, they would have told me, \"A faster horse!\"' People don't know what they want until you show it to them. That's why I never rely on market research. Our task is to read things that are not yet on the page.</blockquote>
<p>And from the same founder who, when told the iPhone 4 had serious antenna issues, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2010/06/24/apple-responds-over-iphone-4-reception-issues-youre-holding-th/\">told users</a> that they were holding the phone wrong?</p>
<h2>A Kinder, Gentler Apple</h2>
<p>This is a very different Apple. When you read Cook's apologies <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/letter-from-tim-cook-on-maps/\">on Apple Maps problems</a> or now on China, they actually read like <em>he's sorry</em>, and not simply going through the motions of looking apologetic.</p>
<p>It's a kinder, gentler Apple. And I'm not sure I like it.</p>
<p>Sure, there are good reasons for Apple to apologize. For one thing, it's the right thing to do when someone, or some company, messes up. For another, it's good business, and given Apple's recent stock market stumbles, making peace with Apple's biggest future market - worth $22.5 billion in fiscal 2012 and on a torrid growth pace - makes a lot of sense, as <em>All Things D</em>'s <a href=\"http://allthingsd.com/20130402/apple-had-to-apologize-to-china/\">John Paczkowski posits</a>.</p>
<h2>Missing Apple's Arrogance</h2>
<p>But I liked the Apple that was infuriating in its smug assurance that it was right. Because most of the time, it was, and holding its ground forced the industry to be more circumspect about easy assumptions about what would work. I know that I, personally, have been proved wrong many times about Apple, and am grateful that it <a href=\"http://www.appolicious.com/articles/2362-steve-jobs-apologizes-to-apple-customers-while-taking-shots-at-the-media\">hasn't listened to what I or others in the media were saying</a>.</p>
<p>Or, as former Apple employee <a href=\"http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-20117575-37/what-i-learned-from-steve-jobs/\">Guy Kawasaki tells it</a>,</p>
<blockquote>“Apple market research” is an oxymoron. The Apple focus group was the right hemisphere of Steve’s brain talking to the left one. If you ask customers what they want, they will tell you, “Better, faster, and cheaper”--that is, better sameness, not revolutionary change. They can describe their desires only in terms of what they are already using….The richest vein for tech startups is creating the product that you want to use—that’s what Steve and Woz did.</blockquote>
<p>Whatever the Chinese blow-up, if you've ever called Apple on a support issue or visited an Apple Store, you know that <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/carminegallo/2012/08/30/apples-secret-employee-training-manual-reinvents-customer-service-in-seven-ways/\">Apple has exceptional customer support</a>. Better than any other technology company that I know. It rivals Nordstrom, it's so good.</p>
<p>I suppose Apple felt the need to make China happy, but I hate seeing it prostrate itself and become something it's not: humble. Apple is great because it pays little attention to critics. Or used to. Lately it's been apologizing somewhat regularly. I want the unapologetic, arrogant Apple back.</p><div class=\"feedflare\">

It would soon take on a life of its own. Developers saw the value that Twitter could bring and started developing apps, clients and revenue models. Twitter, without really meaning to, had become a platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That platform, as Twitter generally saw it, was a threat to Twitter itself. In the past several years, Twitter has <a href=\"http://readwrite.com/2011/03/24/burned-by-twitters-api\" target=\"_blank\">restricted access to its APIs</a>, cut off some developer shops entirely and <a href=\"http://readwrite.com/2011/03/11/twitter_tells_developers_to_stop_building_twitter\" target=\"_blank\">consolidated control of the platform</a> to its own headquarters. <a href=\"http://readwrite.com/2012/08/16/developers-are-pissed-frustrated-by-new-twitter-decree\" target=\"_blank\">The developer community was outraged.</a></p>
<p>Twitter may have had a method to its madness. Yesterday, Twitter gave birth to “<a href=\"http://blog.twitter.com/2013/04/new-mobile-updates-for-android-iphone.html\" target=\"_blank\">Cards</a>” – a way for developers and media to connect their apps, media, products, photos, videos and galleries to Tweets. Cards is kind of a reverse method for Twitter to re-open its platform to developers and media. Consider it Twitter’s way of giving back to the developers it once spurned.</p>
<h2>What Are Twitter Cards?</h2>
<p>Twitter is getting meta. Metadata, that is.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href=\"https://dev.twitter.com/blog/mobile-app-deep-linking-and-new-cards\" target=\"_blank\">Essentially, Cards is all about metadata.</a> If you are unfamiliar with the term, metadata is data that describes other kinds of data. For instance, where did a Tweet come from (an app, publication, button)? What location did it come from and what time of day? What kind of media is attached to it? Twitter has long kept track of this data and allowed developers to use some of it. Most users on Twitter have little idea that one Tweet can generate more than a dozen different data points.</p>
<p>Twitter is now taking some of that data and making it forward facing to the public. Developers can access this data by choosing the type of Card they want (there are six kinds), inserting the proper meta tags and validating the content through Twitter. By doing that, Cards will be able to connect straight from Twitter to a variety of media, including apps. Or products. Twitter calls this process of “deep linking.”</p>
<p>What does that mean though? “Twitter now directly links to my app?” Really, it means exactly what it says.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class=\"embedded-Media-image img-caption-c\">
				<img src=\"http://readwrite.com/files/twitter_card_path.jpg\" style=\"\" />
				<span class=\"embedded-Media-image-caption\">Twitter card as seen on Twitter.com</span>
		</span>
</p>
<p>Let’s take the example of mobile social network Path. I, the user, post a picture to Path and tweet it from the Path app for Android or iOS. You, my follower, see that photo and open the tweet from on the Web, mobile Web, iOS or Android.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since Path has set up Cards, on the bottom of you the tweet you will see “Get the Path app.” Click on that and Twitter will send you straight to Path on your device. If you don’t have Path installed, you will be directed to sign up for the service.</p>
<p><span class=\"embedded-Media-image img-caption-c\">
				<img src=\"http://readwrite.com/files/path_from_twitter.jpg\" style=\"\" />
				<span class=\"embedded-Media-image-caption\">Click the link, you are sent to Path on the Web. Same would work for Path mobile app.</span>
		</span>
</p>
<p>For web sites, it is similar. Say I post one of my articles to Twitter (which I do, often). The Card will give a preview of my article and on the bottom it will say “View on ReadWrite.” That button will take you to the ReadWrite web site on whatever device you are using. We do not have a dedicated app for Android or iOS anymore, but if we did we could direct you there, too.</p>
<p>There are six kinds of Cards that you can now create. Per Twitter’s own description:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\"><strong>Summary Card:</strong> Default card, including a title, description, thumbnail and Twitter account attribution</span></li>
<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\"><strong>Photo Card</strong>: A Tweet sized photo card</span></li>
<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\"><strong>Gallery Card:</strong> A Tweet card geared toward highlighting a collection of photos</span></li>
<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\"><strong>App Card:</strong> A Tweet card for providing a profile of an application</span></li>
<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\"><strong>Player Card:</strong> A Tweet sized video/audio/media player card</span></li>
<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\"><strong>Product Card:</strong> A Tweet card to better represent product content</span></li>
</ul>
<h2>What Is New?</h2>
<p>The concept of Cards is not actually new at Twitter. Showing the preview of photos, articles and web sites from a link has been available since the middle of 2012. What is new are the expansion of the types of cards as well as the update to the Android, iOS and mobile web apps.</p>
<p>This is where it gets interesting.</p>
<p>Twitter has created the capability to send users all over the Internet. We are not just talking about links anymore. We are talking native apps, mobile web sites, or various types of media that can either stand alone or live within those apps. Twitter has basically just created a platform that can act as a directional compass for the Internet. One word for that is “platform.”</p>
<p>Platform is a very developer-centric term. When it comes to the Web and mobile apps, it more or less means “something that can be built on top of.” For Twitter, Cards has another type of connotation for its users:</p>
<p>Portal.</p>
<h2>Portal 2.0</h2>
<p>Portal has become something of a nasty word on the Web over the past several years. When we think portal, we think of the old AOL homepage or Yahoo or even iGoogle (which Google will kill on Nov. 1, 2013). Twitter Cards are like Portal 2.0, in a similar manner that Facebook has become. Portal 2.0 is inherently social and does not just send you to other Web content the way the original portals did. Portal 2.0 can send you a variety of types of media, like the app or the product page.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For instance, an enterprising company could use Cards to link to a product, like a pair of sunglasses. You could then purchase those new sunglasses from the site. Twitter could even be the arbiter of the transaction by using your account as authentication, tied to a credit card or other payment service.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, Cards as an example of Portal 2.0 are social, mobile, directional, built as a platform and, perhaps, transactional.</p><div class=\"feedflare\">

But is the electronics giant getting in front of where consumers really buy their technology?</p>
<p>The new in-store shops will have Samsung employees demo and sell a wide range of Samsung's products, including smartphones, tablets and televisions.&nbsp;Five hundred of these mini-stores will be open by April 8, in time to help promote the upcoming Samsung Galaxy S4 smartphone.</p>
<p>In an <a title=\"http://www.zdnet.com/samsung-enters-the-us-retail-space-opens-stores-7000013509/\" href=\"http://www.zdnet.com/samsung-enters-the-us-retail-space-opens-stores-7000013509/\">interview with ZDNet</a>, Ketrina Dunagan, VP of Retail Marketing for Samsung Mobile's U.S. unit, said something interesting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>\"This is our first opportunity to demonstrate connected mobile products in a location with educated Samsung employees able to walk a consumer through the experience. About 70 percent of U.S. population is within 10 miles of a Best Buy.\"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This got me to thinking: is proximity alone enough of a draw for consumers? For me, it isn't. I have a long-standing arrangement with Best Buys and similar stores: don't bother me. If I walk in to one, I usually know what I want and am not interested in talking to the sales staff. I would much rather just get my tech online, where I can save some money.</p>
<p>But that's just me, of course. Where is it you go for your general tech needs? Most of us, usually, hit our carrier's storefront for our phone needs, but what about the rest of your tech purchases?</p>
<p>For instance, do you visit large electronics/appliance stores like Best Buy or Fry's? Or is a megastore like Wal-Mart or Mejer's more your speed? Some people want to go even deeper on discounts and will shop at warehouse stores like Costco or Sam's Club.</p>
<p>True Apple fans will find the nearest Apple store, of course, and Microsoft also has a slowly expanding base of brick-and-mortar outlets. Or do you buy direct from the vendor, shopping at their online commerce site?</p>
<p>Amazon is also a popular place to buy tech, and many people shop for bargains at such third-party outlets, both online and physical.</p>

(description nil "<p>Once upon a time, air travel was just about the only time I could escape the Internet. Now with in-flight Wi-Fi becoming more pervasive, even air travel has become a time to check Twitter, respond to emails and keep up with Arsenal's latest loss. I nearly always fly Delta, which has Wi-Fi on virtually every flight. But for those who fly other airlines, here's a quick review of which airlines lead and which lag in providing in-flight Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>As of September 2012, only <a href=\"http://www.thebeat.travel/post/2012/09/20/Delta-Leader-Inflight-Wi-Fi.aspx\">31% of US domestic flights</a> came equipped with in-flight Wi-Fi, nearly always through GoGo Internet, though there are <a href=\"http://www.informationweek.com/byte/personal-tech/wireless/byte-guide-to-in-flight-wi-fi/240144399\">other options</a>. Then, as now, Delta led the pack, but now everyone, including Delta, has expanded coverage. While only 5 to 10% of travelers actually use in-flight Wi-Fi, for those who do, it can be essential. (And peace destroying, but that's hardly the airlines' fault.)</p>
<p>Here's how things stack up:</p>
<ul>

</h2>
<h2>First, The Rules</h2>
<p>There are potentially lots of ways someone could prevent themselves from being recorded, but in the interests of public safety and dignity, let's establish some ground rules right up front.</p>
<p><strong>Rule #1. Break No Laws:&nbsp;</strong>Clearly, one effective method of blocking Google Glass would be to just walk up and slap the things off someone's face and step on the devices when they fall to the ground.</p>
<p>I think we can all agree: <em>that's not a good solution</em>.</p>
<p>As tempting as it might be, causing personal injury and property damage is wrong and, frankly, stupid. So for the purposes of this exploration, any technique that breaks existing laws or causes lasting harm will be immediately disqualified.</p>
<p><strong>Rule #2. Don't Look Like A Dork:&nbsp;</strong>Wearing a knight's helm or a cardboard box on your head would certainly prevent the recording of your face while walking down the street, but it might also look a bit strange.</p>
<p>Let's assume that any acceptable blocking technique will not involve wearing something that falls way outside the norm for a given culture.</p>
<p><span class=\"embedded-Media-image img-caption-c\">
				<img src=\"http://readwrite.com/files/google-glass-sunglasses.jpg\" style=\"\" />
			</span>
</p>
<h2>Solutions Already Presented</h2>
<p>In some circles on the Internet, there have already been some suggestions about how to block these devices, all primarily based around actively jamming Google Glass. But, alas, there are problems with the existing technology behind every one of these solutions.</p>
<p><strong>Blinded By The Light:&nbsp;</strong>One rather drastic jamming method involves actively aiming a laser at the camera lens of a Glass device to effectively blind it.&nbsp;This would probably work, but involves some serious risks - that camera lens will be very close to someone's eye. A miss, therefore, could cause serious injury. Plus, given that both the laser and the Google Glass wearer could be moving, the odds of actually hitting the Google Glass camera lens would be very low, even for an automated targeting system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So lasers are out.&nbsp;(See Rule #1.)</p>
<p>Visible light shone in the general direction of a Google Glass wearer might be less dangerous, but in order to work - especially in broad daylight - they'd have to be bright enough to dazzle or distract the Glass wearers... and anyone standing (or driving) nearby. Focusing the beams to minimize light leakage could lead to the same issues faced by laser blinding.</p>
<p><strong>Infrared Jamming:&nbsp;</strong>For quite some time now, people have been kicking around the idea of using infrared LED lights to block security cameras from seeing someone's face. It might seem logical to apply that idea to jamming Google Glass, since infrared (IR) light is invisible to the human eye.</p>
<p>But such IR jammers, when they work at all - and there's some evidence they don't - would be effective only for cameras that use IR to monitor scenes in low-light situations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As far as we know, though, Google Glass' camera won't use IR sensors. So an array of IR LED lights worn on a hat or in a hood would be completely invisible to a Glass camera. And even if Glass <em>does</em> use IR sensing, there's no way any IR LED light could outshine ambient sunlight in daytime situations. Not without a huge power supply and creating enough heat to melt your face off. (See Rule #2.)</p>
<p><strong>Radio Frequency Jamming:&nbsp;</strong>The Internet is full of sites selling these bad boys: frequency jammers that can work on cell, WiFi and even Bluetooth frequencies.&nbsp;This would probably cover all the signals that Glass would use, and render these devices offline in your immediate vicinity. Of course, they would also disable any Internet-connected or cellular devices in range. That kind of overkill might or might not bother you, but it definitely bothers the FCC. In the U.S., at least, there's a much bigger problem: any active jamming of public radio frequencies is against the law. (See Rule #1.)</p>
<h2>Things That Might Actually Work</h2>
<p>Is there, then, no hope? Will we have to just endure the onslaught of Glass-like devices? Perhaps not. There are a few things that might provide a measure of privacy.</p>
<p><strong>Get Me Wardrobe:&nbsp;</strong>While tin-foil hats and the like would bust the \"dork\" rule, there should be some fashion choices that would help hide your identity.&nbsp;Big sunglasses, head scarves, large-brimmed hats… all kinds of accessories could mask your face in the presence of a Glass device. It's far from 100% protection, of course, but it's better than nothing.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span class=\"embedded-Media-image img-caption-r\">
				<img src=\"http://readwrite.com/files/google-glass-ban.png\" style=\"\" />
			</span>
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Glass-Free Zones:&nbsp;</strong>You may not have to worry about Glass use everywhere you go. Many locations are already leery of camera use, and are likely to enact rules again wearing Google Glass or similar devices.&nbsp;Just try to take a picture in a grocery store or a bank, for instance, and you will be firmly told to stop. Movie theaters, department stores, hospitals… there are many places where privacy and security concerns mean no photography is allowed.</p>
<p>It is unlikely that such restrictions will relax for Glass. In fact, we are seeing early evidence that some businesses are already imposing Glass-specific restrictions - including <a href=\"http://venturebeat.com/2013/03/09/seattle-bar-bans-google-glass-to-prevent-invasion-of-privacy-and-ugly-eyewear/\" target=\"_blank\">this Seattle bar</a>. Groups are forming to <a href=\"http://stopthecyborgs.org/google-glass-ban-signs/\" target=\"_blank\">encourage creation of Glass-free havens</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Opt-Out Signals:&nbsp;</strong>Finally, here's an idea that might solve the problem once and for all.&nbsp;Building on the LED-light idea, what if there was a tiny light on your person displaying a certain color that, when detected by Glass, would immediately blur your appearance on any recording? Or a special signal broadcast on Bluetooth from your phone that would do the same thing?</p>
<p>Obviously, this would require cooperation from Google's engineers to make sure the devices recognize and act upon the agreed-upon signals. And such a scheme probably could - and would - be hacked. But supporting an opt-out approach might be the easiest, best way to accomodate the rise of these devices without compromising the privacy of everyone in sight.</p>
<p>These are just a few ideas that could help prevent detection/recording by Google Glass. There have got to be more and better ways, so please share your ideas in the comments below.</p>

<p>Except it hasn't said that, quite. But it is, and saying so is really important.</p>
<p>The market-research firm predicts a 7.6% decline in PC sales this year, to 315 million units (including desktops and notebooks) from the roughly 341 million PCs sold in 2012. The real knife in the PC's heart, though, is that Gartner is now finally willing to predict a long-term decline: 302 million PCs in 2014, falling to 272 million in 2017, approaching the sales levels of 2006 and 2007.&nbsp;</p>
<p>\"While there will be some individuals who retain both a personal PC and a tablet, especially those who use either or both for work and play, most will be satisfied with the experience they get from a tablet as their main computing device,\" said Carolina Milanesi, research vice president at Gartner, in a statement. \"As consumers shift their time away from their PC to tablets and smartphones, they will no longer see their PC as a device that they need to replace on a regular basis.\"</p>
<p><span class=\"embedded-Media-image img-caption-c\">
<img src=\"http://readwrite.com/files/Gartner%202013%20pc%2C%20tablet%20data.png\" style=\"\" />
</span>
</p>
<p>Gartner predicted that tablet sales would outpace the PC market sometime between 2014 and and 2017. By then, the firm predicted, manufacturers will sell 468 million tablets, almost double that of the PC market. Phone sales will top 2 billion units.</p>
<h2>What Gartner Can't Say, And Why</h2>
<p>Gartner, however, can't bring itself to say the PC market is shrinking toward irrelevance. Instead, it describes the PC market as \"transitional,\" in much the same way companies firing large swathes of their workforces insist that employees have been \"downsized.\" If Gartner was a brokerage firm, its analyst would have placed a \"hold\" rating on the PC market, with all the wishy-washy implications that word connotes.</p>
<p>\"Transitional\" is one of those wussy words that says nothing. Here it's designed primarily to protect the lucrative relationship that Gartner has with its clients. If Gartner declares an industry dead, why should a company like Dell spend thousands of dollars a pop for a report that says so?</p>
<p>\"An analyst cannot issue a sell rating because he doesn't want to lose access,'' <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aaQDUAN2hm5Q\" target=\"_blank\">former securities analyst Tom Larsen told Bloomberg</a>&nbsp;in 2007. Exactly.</p>
<p>To Gartner's credit, the company began <a href=\"http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/1479114\" target=\"_blank\">hedging its bets</a> way back into 2010, when the company noted five \"disruptive forces\" challenging the PC industry, which I've condensed to three below:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\" data-mce-mark=\"1\">Stale \"mature markets\" like the United States;</span></li>
<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\" data-mce-mark=\"1\">Thin clients;</span></li>
<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\">A shift in consumer purchasing habits to tablets and other mobile devices that would displace PC sales and incline companies and individuals to keep PCs longer.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Only that last point appears prescient today — and only if you forget that Gartner issued its report in Nov. 2010, seven months after Apple launched the iPad.</p>
<h2>Why Gartner's Hedging Matters</h2>
<p>On balance, then, Gartner's report is nothing more than a reactive sell-side Wall Street analyst which issues a \"sell\" recommendation after a company has already issued bad news that's tanked its stock. The PC industry is dying, so let's move on.</p>
<p>But we actually need a company like Gartner to declare the PC dead — or at least to release data that supports that view, as it's just done, because companies across all industries use reports from Gartner, IDC, and others to justify their investments.</p>
<p>In order to develop a new PC version of TurboTax, for example, Intuit must demonstrate that there's a market for it. Gartner's report indicates that Intuit and other PC developers should consider abandoning the PC in favor of either a Web service or dedicated applications for various mobile platforms, at least if they want to address a market that's growing instead of shrinking.</p>
<p>We've known since 2010 that mobile devices would play an ever increasing role in our lives. But it's become increasingly clear that the cycle may be accelerating.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over at his blog Tech-Thoughts, analyst Sameer Singh noted recently that developers are already picking up on this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[T]he growth of Windows 8 apps has noticeably slowed in Q1 2013.&nbsp;According to the data, the Windows Store is expected to top 50,000 apps by the end of March, but MoM [month-over-month] growth has slowed to just 10-15%.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the trend continues, the reasons for buying a new PC also decline. Microsoft has begun paying small developers a pittance — <a href=\"http://build.windowsstore.com/keepthecash\" target=\"_blank\">$100 per app</a> — to develop for the Windows 8 platform. But that's barely going to pay for a round of beer and appetizers at the end of the day.</p>
<p>\"Microsoft's promotion is primarily aimed at low-end publishers,\" Singh wrote. \"Their prime concern at the moment isn't app quality, but quantity. Unless the app growth on the Windows Store remains strong, Microsoft has very little chance of attracting many major developers to the platform.\"</p>
<p>Gartner's data would indicate that Microsoft faces long odds there. Even if Gartner's too scared to say it.</p>

<p>Gartner predicted that tablet sales would outpace the PC market sometime between 2014 and and 2017. By then, the firm predicted, manufacturers will sell 468 million tablets, almost double that of the PC market. Phone sales will top 2 billion units.</p>
<h2>What Gartner Can't Say, And Why</h2>
<p>Gartner, however, can't bring itself to say the PC market is shrinking toward irrelevance. Instead, it describes the PC market as \"transitional,\" in much the same way companies firing large swathes of their workforces insist that employees have been \"downsized.\" If Gartner was a brokerage firm, its analyst would have placed a \"hold\" rating on the PC market, with all the wishy-washy implications that word connotes.</p>
<p>\"Transitional\" is one of those wussy words that says nothing. Here it's designed primarily to protect the lucrative relationship that Gartner has with its clients. If Gartner declares an industry dead, why should a company like Dell spend thousands of dollars a pop for a report that says so?</p>
<p>\"An analyst cannot issue a sell rating because he doesn't want to lose access,'' <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aaQDUAN2hm5Q\" target=\"_blank\">former securities analyst Tom Larsen told Bloomberg</a>&nbsp;in 2007. Exactly.</p>
<p>To Gartner's credit, the company began <a href=\"http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/1479114\" target=\"_blank\">hedging its bets</a> way back into 2010, when the company noted five \"disruptive forces\" challenging the PC industry, which I've condensed to three below:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\" data-mce-mark=\"1\">Stale \"mature markets\" like the United States;</span></li>
<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\" data-mce-mark=\"1\">Thin clients;</span></li>
<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\">A shift in consumer purchasing habits to tablets and other mobile devices that would displace PC sales and incline companies and individuals to keep PCs longer.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Only that last point appears prescient today — and only if you forget that Gartner issued its report in Nov. 2010, seven months after Apple launched the iPad.</p>
<h2>Why Gartner's Hedging Matters</h2>
<p>On balance, then, Gartner's report is nothing more than a reactive sell-side Wall Street analyst which issues a \"sell\" recommendation after a company has already issued bad news that's tanked its stock. The PC industry is dying, so let's move on.</p>
<p>But we actually need a company like Gartner to declare the PC dead — or at least to release data that supports that view, as it's just done, because companies across all industries use reports from Gartner, IDC, and others to justify their investments.</p>
<p>In order to develop a new PC version of TurboTax, for example, Intuit must demonstrate that there's a market for it. Gartner's report indicates that Intuit and other PC developers should consider abandoning the PC in favor of either a Web service or dedicated applications for various mobile platforms, at least if they want to address a market that's growing instead of shrinking.</p>
<p>We've known since 2010 that mobile devices would play an ever increasing role in our lives. But it's become increasingly clear that the cycle may be accelerating.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over at his blog Tech-Thoughts, analyst Sameer Singh noted recently that developers are already picking up on this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[T]he growth of Windows 8 apps has noticeably slowed in Q1 2013.&nbsp;According to the data, the Windows Store is expected to top 50,000 apps by the end of March, but MoM [month-over-month] growth has slowed to just 10-15%.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the trend continues, the reasons for buying a new PC also decline. Microsoft has begun paying small developers a pittance — <a href=\"http://build.windowsstore.com/keepthecash\" target=\"_blank\">$100 per app</a> — to develop for the Windows 8 platform. But that's barely going to pay for a round of beer and appetizers at the end of the day.</p>
<p>\"Microsoft's promotion is primarily aimed at low-end publishers,\" Singh wrote. \"Their prime concern at the moment isn't app quality, but quantity. Unless the app growth on the Windows Store remains strong, Microsoft has very little chance of attracting many major developers to the platform.\"</p>
<p>Gartner's data would indicate that Microsoft faces long odds there. Even if Gartner's too scared to say it.</p>

Included in those numbers are apps that siphoned off one or more of the three.</p>
<p>Many apps don't stop there. Other data they glom onto includes your browsing activity, your contact list, the unique identification number of your device and even your call registry.</p>
<p>These apps took all that information legally. Android apps display their privacy policies in seeking permission to gather personal data, and many developers bank on the fact that most people will just click through to the app.</p>

<p>All that data gathering typically starts when an app developer download an ad framework provided by more than 400 companies listed on the <a href=\"http://www.adnetworkdirectory.com/\" target=\"_self\">Ad Network Directory</a>. Such frameworks makes it easy for developers to display ads in the app, and thus to get paid every time someone clicks on them.</p>
<p>Since free apps only make money for developers from such clicks (and, it turns out, the distribution of associated user data), very few pay attention to exactly what kind of information ad frameworks are gathering.</p>
<p>\"Because they copy-paste the code, they don't really debug it; they don't really look through it and see what data it collects,\" Bitdefender researcher Liviu Arsene told me. \"I bet they don't even care.\"</p>
<h2>And It Doesn't Stop There</h2>
<p>App privacy policies often stake out even more aggressive data-collection goals, presumably to pave the way for future updates to vacuum up more info and further erode user privacy.</p>
<p>Take, for instance, <a href=\"http://www.airpush.com/\" target=\"_self\">Airpush</a>, the second-largest ad network for Android developers with 40,000 apps. Its privacy policy reads, in part:</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The policy goes on to explain that Airpush might supply that information to third-party advertisers who are part of its ad platform and third-party vendors, consultants and other service providers. Because the data is available to so many organizations, it's virtually impossible to know who is using your personal data, and how, once it leaves the device.</p>
<p>Obviously, the possibilities for abuse here are legion. Suppose one of those third-party organizations is acquired by an outfit that is, shall we say, less reputable. Or that a third party company's computers are hacked, spilling your data into the hands of cybercriminals.</p>

Does Apple care?</p>
<p>Probably not, although it should. More than an app, though not quite a operating system, Facebook Home delivers a highly visual, system-wide presentation of real-time social data that also makes innovative use of touch-based gestures. In the process, it makes iOS look, well, dated.</p>
<p>Jony Ive, call your office.</p>
<h2>Why Apple Shouldn't Worry About Home</h2>
<p>In the short term, Apple has relatively little to fear. Tech blogger and Apple enthusiast <a style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\" href=\"http://readwrite.com/author/dan-frommer\" target=\"_blank\">Dan Frommer</a>, for instance,&nbsp;argues that Apple retains a \"big lead in hardware and OS quality, apps, media, and customer service\" — and that as a result, we shouldn't expect to see&nbsp;<a style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\" href=\"http://www.splatf.com/2013/04/facebook-phone-potential/\" target=\"_blank\">iPhone users bolt to Facebook phones</a>, at least not yet. Instead,&nbsp;he figures Facebook Home will likely appeal to buyers of low-end Android devices.</p>
<p><strong>(See also: <a href=\"http://readwrite.com/2013/04/04/facebook-home-a-facebook-phone-and-a-new-facebook-mobile-experience\">Facebook Home: A Slick Interface &amp; A Big Challenge</a>)</strong></p>
<p>Mobile analyst <a href=\"http://ben-evans.com\" target=\"_blank\">Benedict Evans</a> told me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The barriers to switching between platforms are pretty large: a slightly easier way to access Facebook Messenger won't be enough to make people make the switch. That's particularly the case for iPhone, which has a 70-80% repurchase intention rate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similarly, from Asymco analyst&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.asymco.com\" target=\"_blank\">Horace Dediu</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the phone business there are three things which define a product's volume: distribution, distribution and distribution.&nbsp;Home is a more ambitious version of an app (designed to extract more from the user) and so it is more constrained in all three areas. It needs \"permission\" from device makers, platform vendors and operators in order to proliferate. End user installation is an option but it's not likely to drive large volumes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dediu's quick analysis of Home leads him to believe that it could drive up to 10 million units a year. That's not nothing, of course, but still a pittance compared to the approximately 48 million iPhones Apple sold just last quarter.</p>
<h2>Why Apple Should Worry About Home</h2>
<p>Home, however, could have a significant long-term impact on iPhone's app-centric user interface. This might be to Apple's benefit.</p>

<p>At yesterday's Home launch, Mark Zuckerberg oh-so-delicately suggested that iOS — iPhone's operating system — is looking a bit out-of-touch these days:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Instead of our phones being designed around apps first, what if we flip that around? What if our phones were designed around people first?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, Home's&nbsp;innovative system-wide presentation and highly visual user experience may even serve as a guide to <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/pr/bios/jonathan-ive.html\" target=\"_blank\">Apple design guru</a>&nbsp;Jonathan Ive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Facebook Home effectively takes over a device's lock screen, populating it in real-time with the user's Newsfeed, photo stream and Facebook-sanctioned notifications. Updates from the user's Facebook contacts, or a Facebook message, for example, are revealed instantly no matter what app is active through the clever use of \"chat heads.\"</p>
<p>Chat heads also supports texting and messaging from within another (non-Facebook) app. Facebook Home's notifications include the individual's profile picture and can be displayed in a card-like fashion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are visually appealing features which are not available in the iPhone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's Zuckerberg belaboring the point yesterday:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We're not building a phone, and we're not building an OS — we're building an experience that's deeper than any other app.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Apple Is Playing Catch-Up</h2>
<p>You have to assume that Ive and Apple's iOS design team are poring over every detail Zuckerberg and company revealed yesterday.&nbsp;Earlier this week, Apple bloggers&nbsp;such as Mark Gurman, M.G. Siegler, Rene Richie and John Gruber discussed <a href=\"http://branch.com/b/apple-to-begin-iphone-production-this-quarter\" target=\"_blank\">ways Apple might update iOS</a>&nbsp;on the discussion site Branch.&nbsp;Consider these snippets from their public conversation:&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Apple should use WWDC to introduce and explain new functionality... and improve iOS inter-app communication. Admit that some things sucked/sucks.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>(Design chief Jony) Ive's work is apparently making many people really happy, but will also apparently make rich-texture-loving designers sad.</em></p>
<p><em>Ive getting his hands on the UI might alter the consumer-facing bullet points, but probably not the API's that were planned.</em></p>
<p><em>Ive is pushing a more “flat design” that is starker and simpler, according to developers who have spoken to Apple employees but didn’t have further details. Overall, they expect any changes to be pretty conservative.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is clearly an opportunity for Apple to maintain its closed platform while still supporting greater inter-app communications, more robust developer access to the lock-screen, multi-modal personal communications, and the effective integration of data and contacts across apps, just like Home.</p>
<p>While iPhone hardware has clearly evolved, a 2008 iPhone user would feel immediately at home with iOS in 2013. There is good in such stability - and it is a testament to how much Apple got right, and how far ahead of the competition it was upon launch. However, as our smartphones do more and play a larger role in people's lives, Apple cannot stand still - nor be perceived as standing still.</p>

Does Apple care?</p>
<p>Probably not, although it should. More than an app, though not quite a operating system, Facebook Home delivers a highly visual, system-wide presentation of real-time social data that also makes innovative use of touch-based gestures. In the process, it makes iOS look, well, dated.</p>
<p>Jony Ive, call your office.</p>
<h2>Why Apple Shouldn't Worry About Home</h2>
<p>In the short term, Apple has relatively little to fear. Tech blogger and Apple enthusiast <a style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\" href=\"http://readwrite.com/author/dan-frommer\" target=\"_blank\">Dan Frommer</a>, for instance,&nbsp;argues that Apple retains a \"big lead in hardware and OS quality, apps, media, and customer service\" — and that as a result, we shouldn't expect to see&nbsp;<a style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\" href=\"http://www.splatf.com/2013/04/facebook-phone-potential/\" target=\"_blank\">iPhone users bolt to Facebook phones</a>, at least not yet. Instead,&nbsp;he figures Facebook Home will likely appeal to buyers of low-end Android devices.</p>
<p><strong>(See also: <a href=\"http://readwrite.com/2013/04/04/facebook-home-a-facebook-phone-and-a-new-facebook-mobile-experience\">Facebook Home: A Slick Interface &amp; A Big Challenge</a>)</strong></p>
<p>Mobile analyst <a href=\"http://ben-evans.com\" target=\"_blank\">Benedict Evans</a> told me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The barriers to switching between platforms are pretty large: a slightly easier way to access Facebook Messenger won't be enough to make people make the switch. That's particularly the case for iPhone, which has a 70-80% repurchase intention rate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similarly, from Asymco analyst&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.asymco.com\" target=\"_blank\">Horace Dediu</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the phone business there are three things which define a product's volume: distribution, distribution and distribution.&nbsp;Home is a more ambitious version of an app (designed to extract more from the user) and so it is more constrained in all three areas. It needs \"permission\" from device makers, platform vendors and operators in order to proliferate. End user installation is an option but it's not likely to drive large volumes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>(See also: <a href=\"http://readwrite.com/2013/04/04/facebook-home-could-be-a-pain-unless-you-really-really-love-facebook\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook Home Could Be A Pain, Unless You Really Love Facebook</a>)</strong></p>
<p>Dediu's quick analysis of Home leads him to believe that it could drive up to 10 million units a year. That's not nothing, of course, but still a pittance compared to the approximately 48 million iPhones Apple sold just last quarter.</p>
<h2>Why Apple Should Worry About Home</h2>
<p>Home, however, could have a significant long-term impact on iPhone's app-centric user interface. This might be to Apple's benefit.</p>

<p>At yesterday's Home launch, Mark Zuckerberg oh-so-delicately suggested that iOS — iPhone's operating system — is looking a bit out-of-touch these days:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Instead of our phones being designed around apps first, what if we flip that around? What if our phones were designed around people first?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, Home's&nbsp;innovative system-wide presentation and highly visual user experience may even serve as a guide to <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/pr/bios/jonathan-ive.html\" target=\"_blank\">Apple design guru</a>&nbsp;Jonathan Ive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Facebook Home effectively takes over a device's lock screen, populating it in real-time with the user's Newsfeed, photo stream and Facebook-sanctioned notifications. Updates from the user's Facebook contacts, or a Facebook message, for example, are revealed instantly no matter what app is active through the clever use of \"chat heads.\"</p>
<p>Chat heads also supports texting and messaging from within another (non-Facebook) app. Facebook Home's notifications include the individual's profile picture and can be displayed in a card-like fashion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are visually appealing features which are not available in the iPhone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's Zuckerberg belaboring the point yesterday:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We're not building a phone, and we're not building an OS — we're building an experience that's deeper than any other app.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Apple Is Playing Catch-Up</h2>
<p>You have to assume that Ive and Apple's iOS design team are poring over every detail Zuckerberg and company revealed yesterday.&nbsp;Earlier this week, Apple bloggers&nbsp;such as Mark Gurman, M.G. Siegler, Rene Richie and John Gruber discussed <a href=\"http://branch.com/b/apple-to-begin-iphone-production-this-quarter\" target=\"_blank\">ways Apple might update iOS</a>&nbsp;on the discussion site Branch.&nbsp;Consider these snippets from their public conversation:&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class=\"p2\">Amazon And The Promise Of Cloud Computing</h2>
<p class=\"p1\">Is Amazon moving away from cloud computing's core values? The promise of cloud computing lies not only in its technology but in its pricing and packaging structure. The idea is pretty simple: pay for the compute power you use. If you need more, you buy more. If you need less, you buy less.</p>
<p class=\"p1\">This is in obvious contrast to past models in which you buy hardware for your on-premise data center or your colocated space, then live within whatever means you own. That capital expense was slow to react to shifts in demand and put you at risk of over- or under-capacity. Hourly billing freed us from that - most users saw a clear progession toward per minute billing to even more closely match the demand curve.</p>
<p class=\"p1\">Why, then, when you use an Amazon server for 62 minutes do you still get charged for 120 minutes? Multiply that by a couple hundred servers over a year and the difference adds up. How come AWS gives its best prices only with 1-3 year contracts, with up front fees? That sure seems a lot like that step-wise CAPEX spend cloud was supposed to avoid.</p>
<p class=\"p1\">AWS’s pricing page includes several terms that seem anti-cloud, for example:</p>
<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"embedded-Media-image img-caption-c\">
<img src=\"http://readwrite.com/files/awscontract.png\" style=\"\" />
</span>
</p>
<h2 class=\"p2\">It's A Technology Issue</h2>
<p class=\"p1\">If you look at the technology stack, things haven’t progressed much in the last 5 years there either. Have you ever wondered why you get offered <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/\">stock sizes that Amazon selects for you</a> instead of the exact CPU, RAM and block storage you want?</p>
<p class=\"p1\">Because AWS uses Ethernet-based networks, once a virtual machine has been provisioned on physical hardware, it’s stuck there until you turn it off. That's why Amazon users occassionally get emails asking them to turn off their virtual machines.</p>
<p class=\"p1\">As Amazon plays a Tetris-like game of fitting VMs on hardware, you end up paying for capacity you didn’t want just to make Amazon’s life simpler.</p>
<p class=\"p1\">There’s got to be a better way, right? Cloud Computing 2.0 providers are built on technologies like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InfiniBand\">InfiniBand</a>, that allow for 80-gigabit speeds within the network - making it easier to separate CPU cores, RAM and storage to provide infinite options. It also allows a similar flexibility in billing.</p>
<p class=\"p1\">That can make a big difference. <a href=\"https://cloudability.com/\">Cloudability</a>, says the 100 companies it surveyed waste 40% of their Amazon spend buying too many resources.</p>
<p class=\"p1\">Cloud computing is supposed to let you buy your core setup and then become elastic, expanding as you need it and contracting when you don't. If you need computing power for 65 minutes you should pay for 65 minutes. If you need it for three hours, you should pay for three hours. That's the way we can truly achieve the promise the cloud offers.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, CIOs missed the memo, and the dirty little secret is that most of the world's software, including apps, is written for use, not sale. That means that most of the world's software is not going to follow what Facebook's mobile strategy is, but rather what those stodgy enterprises do.</p>
<p>Those stodgy enterprises? They're all in on HTML5.</p>
<p>I spent Wednesday afternoon with a who's who of enterprise CIOs and CTOs in New York City, talking about Big Data, cloud and mobile. With the Facebook Phone in mind, I polled the group on its mobile applications. Every single executive - not one exception - was building hybrid HTML5 apps, meaning the bulk of the app is written in HTML5 with a native wrapper to improve performance, add camera access, etc.</p>
<p>Every. Single. One.</p>
<p>And not just a few such apps. The bulk of their apps were hybrid HTML5 apps, both for internal employees and for external customers.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Going Native?</h2>
<p>Sure, there were some native apps, though generally not yet written for Android. (\"We can't figure out what to do about Android,\" said one executive of a major financial services firm.) But overall, the CIOs I talked to, and there were roughly 100 in the room, were basing their mobile app strategy on hybrid HTML5 apps.</p>
<p>The CIO needs are different from Zynga's, or those of other consumer app developers. Many of the apps they're building are informational in nature, or have such a stringent need for broad access that these enterprises simply can't afford to alienate a particular mobile device demographic. They need to support iOS, Android, Windows, Blackberry, etc. And with the vast majority of mobile OSes now sporting HTML5-compatible browsers, the time is ripe for HTML5 apps.</p>
<h2>Still Hiring For HTML5</h2>
<p>The job numbers bear this out. While HTML5 can get pooh-poohed by consumer app developers like Facebook, it remains&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.indeed.com/jobtrends?q=HTML5%2Cios%2Candroid&amp;l=\">the hottest technology skill</a>, as measured by jobs, more than holding its own with iOS and Android in absolute number of jobs:</p>

<p>And trouncing both iOS and Android in terms of relative job growth:</p>

<p>This corroborates <a href=\"http://www.evansdata.com/press/viewRelease.php?pressID=185\">Evans Data's finding in early 2012</a> that 75% of mobile developers were using or expecting to use HTML5, a number that seems to have moved from aspirational to actual in 2013.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hence, while the media will tend to focus on what it knows best - consumer apps - CIOs are working away on HTML5 strategies.

Yes, there are <a href=\"http://css.dzone.com/articles/building-mobile-applications\">tradeoffs when going HTML5</a>, just as there are tradeoffs when going native. For enterprise CIOs, however, broad, cross-platform access to employees and customers makes HTML5 a winning solution.</p>

Microsoft Cloud War [Infographic]" "<p>Microsoft is gunning for the online productivity tools user base in a big way, marketing Exchange Online in an effort to take on Gmail. So, how do these two platforms compare?</p>
<p>If you're looking at uptime, which is a pretty big number for any cloud-based system, the <a title=\"http://googleenterprise.blogspot.com/2013/04/pure-and-proven-cloud-gmail.html\" href=\"http://googleenterprise.blogspot.com/2013/04/pure-and-proven-cloud-gmail.html\">Google Enterprise team reported earlier this week</a> that their actual Gmail uptime percentage for 2012 was 99.983% - better than Google's guaranteed 99.9% rate.</p>
<p>\"This translates to an average of just over seven minutes of service disruption per month over the last year, and most users experienced no disruption at all,\" Venkat Panchapakesan, Vice President of Engineering reported.</p>
<p>Curious to see how Microsoft compared, the folks at <a title=\"http://www.cloudsherpas.com\" href=\"http://www.cloudsherpas.com\">Cloud Sherpas</a> decided to analyze 151 days of Exchange Online incident reports to get Microsoft's uptime percentage. Their <a title=\"http://blog.cloudsherpas.com/hot-topics/google-apps-vs-office-365-a-comparison-of-gmail-and-exchange-system-availability/\" href=\"http://blog.cloudsherpas.com/hot-topics/google-apps-vs-office-365-a-comparison-of-gmail-and-exchange-system-availability/\">figures were notable</a>: in that measured period, Exchange Online had a 97.929% uptime rate, lower than Microsoft's 99.9% uptime promise.</p>
<p>There are, I would say, a couple of big caveats with this report: first, Cloud Sherpas seems to equate Gmail vs. Exchange stats as a Google Apps vs. Office 365 face off. The last I heard, Gmail was only one part of Google Apps, and Exchange a component of Office 365. Downtime for one does not reflect downtime for all.</p>
<p>Plus, the figures could be cherry picked a bit: Exchange Online was monitored from Sept. 23, 2012 to February 2, 2013, and the reported Gmail figures are from the entire 2012 calendar year, not just the same 151-day timeframe. For all we know, Exchange Online was problem free for all of 2012 until September 22. Or, after January 1 of this year, Gmail tanked a few times.</p>
<p>Google and Microsoft (and their respective proxies) will no doubt be butting heads in this space for quite some time. What is interesting to me are the anecdotal reports I keep hearing from workplaces that have shifted to Google Apps: people love to use Google Apps for collaboration and shared storage, but when documents are actually being created, Microsoft Office is still the tool of choice.</p>
<p>There are no clear winners yet in this space, but for now, there is no getting around the fact that Exchange Online was only up 97.929% for almost half a year, which comes out to just over three days of lost productivity. The infographic below tells Cloud Sherpas' story:</p>

<p>These are the very best of the bunch.</p>
<h2>Revenge of the Nerds</h2>
<p>Released nearly 30 years ago, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088000/?ref_=sr_1\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Revenge of the Nerds</em></a>&nbsp;is the standard by which all nerdy cinema will forevermore be judged against.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adams College freshman nerds Gilbert and Lewis are relentlessly taunted by the jocks of Alpha Beta fraternity. When the jocks force the nerds out of their dorm, the nerds must create their own fraternity — and teach the entire school why nerds matter.&nbsp;Booger and Pointdexter nearly steal the show.&nbsp;</p>
<p><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/Hw6zrInbtQE\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Real Genius</h2>
<p>It was \"Morning in America\" and Hollywood was moving at warp speed to release pro-nerd films. One of the nerdiest ever was <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089886/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Real Genius</em></a>, the story of a boy and another boy, and mostly only boys, except for the rare girl, who were all so super-smart that they were sent off to a sort of Cal Tech Junior High.</p>
<p>Our anti-hero, Mitch, so smart that even his parents don't know what to do with him, helps save the world, gets the girl and learns that the smarter you are the less you <em>need to care</em> about your appearance. Brain power trumps all.&nbsp;</p>
<p><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/FF3pxBRAI0k\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"></iframe>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>WarGames</h2>
<p>Phone Phreaking in 1983, the fallacy of the Cold War, computer hacking, computer gaming — probably no mainstream Hollywood film has ever been as audacious as <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086567/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1\" target=\"_blank\"><em>WarGames</em></a> in its depiction of the power of the nerd. All Matthew Broderick's character wants to do is hack phone systems and play the latest and greatest computer games. Instead, he nearly starts World War III.&nbsp;</p>
<p><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/tAcEzhQ7oqA\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>American Splendor</h2>
<p>If Matthew Broderick's nerd helped avert World War III in WarGames, then twenty years later, following the PC revolution, the Internet revolution, and the bursting of the Internet stock bubble, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0305206/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1\" target=\"_blank\"><em>American Splendor</em></a> offered a smaller, more cynical view of the nerd. The film's depiction of the slovenly, obsessive, radically under-employed&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\">Harvey Pekar&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\">delivered a vision of the nerd as common man. </span></p>
<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\">Only, in this case, one bursting with talent and, if he must admit it, reasonably happy with his meager lot in life. Hoarder Harvey decides to document his life in comic form and it becomes wildly popular — primarily due to its unflinching honesty.&nbsp;The film also offers a brief but inspired depiction of comic artist and uber-nerd, Robert Crumb.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/g19nAE_ihp0\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>X-Men</h2>
<p><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120903/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl\" target=\"_blank\"><em>X-Men</em></a>&nbsp;may be the prototypical Hollywood vision of the nerd. Nerds are, well, born that way. They are endowed with amazing abilities, which makes them stand out from everyone else. X-Men also has,&nbsp;surprisingly, one of the best Nazi prison camp scenes of any film from any genre. Only, it's not about Nazis or the past, but the future — and who will control it.</p>
<p>This being a Hollywood blockbuster, all those born with the special \"X gene\" are, not surprisingly, equally pretty and badass. &nbsp;</p>

When the jocks force the nerds out of their dorm, the nerds must create their own fraternity — and teach the entire school why nerds matter.&nbsp;Booger and Pointdexter nearly steal the show.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Real Genius</h2>
<p>It was \"Morning in America\" and Hollywood was moving at warp speed to release pro-nerd films. One of the nerdiest ever was <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089886/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Real Genius</em></a>, the story of a boy and another boy, and mostly only boys, except for the rare girl, who were all so super-smart that they were sent off to a sort of Cal Tech Junior High.</p>
<p>Our anti-hero, Mitch, so smart that even his parents don't know what to do with him, helps save the world, gets the girl and learns that the smarter you are the less you <em>need to care</em> about your appearance. Brain power trumps all.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>WarGames</h2>
<p>Phone Phreaking in 1983, the fallacy of the Cold War, computer hacking, computer gaming — probably no mainstream Hollywood film has ever been as audacious as <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086567/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1\" target=\"_blank\"><em>WarGames</em></a> in its depiction of the power of the nerd. All Matthew Broderick's character wants to do is hack phone systems and play the latest and greatest computer games. Instead, he nearly starts World War III.&nbsp;</p>
<p><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/tAcEzhQ7oqA\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>American Splendor</h2>
<p>If Matthew Broderick's nerd helped avert World War III in WarGames, then twenty years later, following the PC revolution, the Internet revolution, and the bursting of the Internet stock bubble, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0305206/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1\" target=\"_blank\"><em>American Splendor</em></a> offered a smaller, more cynical view of the nerd. The film's depiction of the slovenly, obsessive, radically under-employed&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\">Harvey Pekar&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\">delivered a vision of the nerd as common man. </span></p>
<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\">Only, in this case, one bursting with talent and, if he must admit it, reasonably happy with his meager lot in life. Hoarder Harvey decides to document his life in comic form and it becomes wildly popular — primarily due to its unflinching honesty.&nbsp;The film also offers a brief but inspired depiction of comic artist and uber-nerd, Robert Crumb.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>X-Men</h2>
<p><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120903/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl\" target=\"_blank\"><em>X-Men</em></a>&nbsp;may be the prototypical Hollywood vision of the nerd. Nerds are, well, born that way. They are endowed with amazing abilities, which makes them stand out from everyone else. X-Men also has,&nbsp;surprisingly, one of the best Nazi prison camp scenes of any film from any genre. Only, it's not about Nazis or the past, but the future — and who will control it.</p>
<p>This being a Hollywood blockbuster, all those born with the special \"X gene\" are, not surprisingly, equally pretty and badass. &nbsp;</p>

<p>This is good news for iOS-loving drug lords, but, more importantly, it's a big win for digital privacy. And from Apple, no less.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With government requests for personal data on the rise, there are few guarantees in place that you or I won't have our private communications snooped through. Since the Fourth Amendment hasn't yet caught up with the lightning fast pace of technological change, some of the best privacy protections are often the ones implemented by tech companies themselves.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>A Rare Privacy Win For Apple&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Apple isn't exactly known as a champion of consumer privacy. It's not reckless either, but few people expect the company to defend users' privacy any more than they the law or consumer sentiment requires.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For a company like Twitter, it's different. Principles like user privacy and free speech have become important enough to the service's core functionality that the company has no choice but to value and protect them. As a result, Twitter <a style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\" href=\"https://www.eff.org/pages/when-government-comes-knocking-who-has-your-back\" target=\"_blank\">gets pretty high marks</a> from privacy advocates.</p>
<p>Even Google, which has had its share of privacy snafus, is pretty good at being transparent and safeguarding its users' privacy generally. Apple? It's as mindful about privacy as it needs to be, but it's not a chief motivator for the company.</p>
<p>By architecting iMessage the way it did, Apple created a messaging protocol more secure and private than standard text messages, which is how millions of people communicate every day. As we fire those texts back and forth, we're all creating a digital trail that can be snooped upon or hacked more easily than we care to think about. But if they're being and sent and received from iPhones running iOS 5 or later, those messages are invisible to wiretaps by law enforcement or other prying eyes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apple didn't have to build iMessage with end-to-end encryption. Gmail isn't encrypted this way, nor are the Facebook messages that are increasingly used like texts on mobile devices. Clearly, SMS text messages aren't particularly well-secured either. Whether winning privacy points was its motivation or not, Apple definitely racks up a few for this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, Apple has had its own share of privacy controversies. <a href=\"http://readwrite.com/2011/04/20/your_iphone_is_tracking_your_every_move\">Locationgate</a> and <a href=\"http://readwrite.com/2011/12/01/its_carrier_iqs_world_we_just_live_in_it\">Carrier IQ</a> come to mind.

The tech press had two immediate reactions to the news, both of them wrong.</p>
<p>Some greeted the news with sadness and longing.&nbsp;Per <a style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\" href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/03/disney-shuts-down-lucasarts-just-154-days-after-acquiring-it/\" target=\"_blank\">TechCrunch</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While the move was not unforeseen (the company’s last few games haven’t been very successful, and rumors of projects being shuttered have trickled in since the acquisition), that doesn’t make today’s news any less disheartening. A part of my childhood — a part of an entire generation of gamer’s collective childhood, really — goes down with LucasArts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From <a href=\"http://news.cnet.com/8301-10797_3-57577786-235/disney-shuttering-lucasarts-moving-to-licensed-games-model/\" target=\"_blank\">CNET</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>\"So, first, Disney cancels the 'Clone Wars,' the best thing to happen to 'Star Wars' since the original trilogy, and now this,\" wrote a commenter on a Kotaku story on the shut-down. \"I am now extremely skeptical of Disney's handling of this company, and I fear [for] the franchise's future.\"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For others, the move was new evidence of the gaming shift from consoles to smartphones, as <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/gamelife/2013/04/lucasarts-disney/\" target=\"_blank\">Wired supposed</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s hard to be surprised at this turn of events when Disney spelled it all out at the time of the acquisition. It’s moving away from internally-developed console games, having shut down Warren Spector’s studio Junction Point following the release of Epic Mickey 2, and towards social and mobile.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the real reason for Disney's shuttering of LucasArts was foretold many years ago in that cinematic classic <em><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094012/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1\" target=\"_blank\">Spaceballs</a></em>: \"Merchandising. Merchandising. Merchandising.\"</p>
<p>Merchandising, as the wise Yogurt tells us, is \"where the real money from the movie is made.\"</p>
<p><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/oNZove4OTtI\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"560\" height=\"420\"></iframe></p>
<p>Consider the official Lucasfilm statement regarding the closing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After evaluating our position in the games market, we’ve decided to shift LucasArts from an internal development to a licensing model, minimizing the company’s risk while achieving a broader portfolio of quality Star Wars games.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's hard to view that statement, and the prominent use of the phrase \"licensing model,\" as meaning anything but this: Disney's Star Wars team is looking forward to revenues, but backwards for, well... for \"content.\"</p>
<h2>It's All About Content. Star Wars Content</h2>
<p>This is not cynical, just (big) business. Business — and Disney is the master of the \"content\" business — is what this acquisition was about, after all. Disney bought content, pure and simple — great big barrels of Star Wars content with which to fill its merchandising channels and theme park attractions and all that vast empty space on the Disney Channel.</p>
<p>Just think of it — all those great concepts like the Death Star, lightsabers and pod racing, and characters such as Luke and Leia, R2D2 and that robot that had the bad cough, all pureed and processed and poured out into any number of new money-making ventures. That's what Disney was buying when it paid for the highly immersive Star Wars universe.</p>
<p>In the Disney calculation, LucasArts was little more than a distraction, if that. The Disney machine already includes a gaming division, an animation studio, and plenty of skilled people already on staff.</p>
<p>Likewise, Disney almost certainly never even considered the proposed <em style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\">Star Wars 1313</em> video game shooter, and probably never thought much — if at all — about many of the division's great legacy games. Even if they produced memorable scenes or characters, these games&nbsp;touch very few people. Disney covets blockbusters — which, of course, are then ground up and forced through all of Disney's many channels.</p>
<h2>The Future According To Disney</h2>
<p>So expect not just a new Star Wars trilogy but a cavalcade of Disney World-Star Wars thrill rides. Assume there will be a Star Wars \"Experience\" at Disneyland. Your daughter will be singing catchy Star Wars-esque tunes she's already heard a million times on the Disney Channel. At night, you'll read your young son one of the many age-appropriate Star Wars books.</p>
<p>New toys, action figures, games — based solely on the original Star Wars blockbusters and the hoped-for blockbusters of the future — will probably sell in the billions. The characters in <em>Toy Story 4</em> will lovingly mock their new friend, the bumbling Jar Jar Binks. Your grandchildren will grow up believing Jango Fett is a spaceman-like Billy the Kid, delivering outlaw justice throughout the furthest corners of the galaxy.</p>
<p>LucasArts was never going to be a part of this grand Disney vision.&nbsp;All you can hope for now is that whatever Disney creates based on their total ownership of the Star Wars universe does not suck.</p>

The tech press had two immediate reactions to the news, both of them wrong.</p>
<p>Some greeted the news with sadness and longing.&nbsp;Per <a style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\" href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/03/disney-shuts-down-lucasarts-just-154-days-after-acquiring-it/\" target=\"_blank\">TechCrunch</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While the move was not unforeseen (the company’s last few games haven’t been very successful, and rumors of projects being shuttered have trickled in since the acquisition), that doesn’t make today’s news any less disheartening. A part of my childhood — a part of an entire generation of gamer’s collective childhood, really — goes down with LucasArts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From <a href=\"http://news.cnet.com/8301-10797_3-57577786-235/disney-shuttering-lucasarts-moving-to-licensed-games-model/\" target=\"_blank\">CNET</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>\"So, first, Disney cancels the 'Clone Wars,' the best thing to happen to 'Star Wars' since the original trilogy, and now this,\" wrote a commenter on a Kotaku story on the shut-down. \"I am now extremely skeptical of Disney's handling of this company, and I fear [for] the franchise's future.\"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For others, the move was new evidence of the gaming shift from consoles to smartphones, as <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/gamelife/2013/04/lucasarts-disney/\" target=\"_blank\">Wired supposed</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s hard to be surprised at this turn of events when Disney spelled it all out at the time of the acquisition. It’s moving away from internally-developed console games, having shut down Warren Spector’s studio Junction Point following the release of Epic Mickey 2, and towards social and mobile.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the real reason for Disney's shuttering of LucasArts was foretold many years ago in that cinematic classic <em><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094012/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1\" target=\"_blank\">Spaceballs</a></em>: \"Merchandising. Merchandising. Merchandising.\"</p>
<p>Merchandising, as the wise Yogurt tells us, is \"where the real money from the movie is made.\"</p>
<p><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/oNZove4OTtI\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"560\" height=\"420\"></iframe></p>
<p>Consider the official Lucasfilm statement regarding the closing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After evaluating our position in the games market, we’ve decided to shift LucasArts from an internal development to a licensing model, minimizing the company’s risk while achieving a broader portfolio of quality Star Wars games.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's hard to view that statement, and the prominent use of the phrase \"licensing model,\" as meaning anything but this: Disney's Star Wars team is looking forward to revenues, but backwards for, well... for \"content.\"</p>
<h2>It's All About Content. Star Wars Content</h2>
<p>This is not cynical, just (big) business. Business — and Disney is the master of the \"content\" business — is what this acquisition was about, after all. Disney bought content, pure and simple — great big barrels of Star Wars content with which to fill its merchandising channels and theme park attractions and all that vast empty space on the Disney Channel.</p>
<p>Just think of it — all those great concepts like the Death Star, lightsabers and pod racing, and characters such as Luke and Leia, R2D2 and that robot that had the bad cough, all pureed and processed and poured out into any number of new money-making ventures. That's what Disney was buying when it paid for the highly immersive Star Wars universe.</p>
<p>In the Disney calculation, LucasArts was little more than a distraction, if that. The Disney machine already includes a gaming division, an animation studio, and plenty of skilled people already on staff.</p>
<p>Likewise, Disney almost certainly never even considered the proposed <em style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\">Star Wars 1313</em> video game shooter, and probably never thought much — if at all — about many of the division's great legacy games. Even if they produced memorable scenes or characters, these games&nbsp;touch very few people. Disney covets blockbusters — which, of course, are then ground up and forced through all of Disney's many channels.</p>
<h2>The Future According To Disney</h2>
<p>So expect not just a new Star Wars trilogy but a cavalcade of Disney World-Star Wars thrill rides. Assume there will be a Star Wars \"Experience\" at Disneyland. Your daughter will be singing catchy Star Wars-esque tunes she's already heard a million times on the Disney Channel. At night, you'll read your young son one of the many age-appropriate Star Wars books.</p>
<p>New toys, action figures, games — based solely on the original Star Wars blockbusters and the hoped-for blockbusters of the future — will probably sell in the billions. The characters in <em>Toy Story 4</em> will lovingly mock their new friend, the bumbling Jar Jar Binks. Your grandchildren will grow up believing Jango Fett is a spaceman-like Billy the Kid, delivering outlaw justice throughout the furthest corners of the galaxy.</p>
<p>LucasArts was never going to be a part of this grand Disney vision.&nbsp;All you can hope for now is that whatever Disney creates based on their total ownership of the Star Wars universe does not suck.</p>

It's far more than just an app and beyond just a skin, but something less than an operating system. It doesn't replace Android or skins like TouchWiz, but installing it will radically transform your Android phone — and not necessarily for the better.</p>
<p>What Home boils down to is this: if you're obsessed with Facebook, Home is for you. But if you'd like to use your Android phone for something else — like checking email, for example — you'll probably find Home more trouble than it's worth.</p>
<p><a style=\"text-decoration: underline;\" href=\"http://readwrite.com/2013/04/04/facebooks-android-home-event-livestream#_tid=hub-hero&amp;_tact=click+%3A+A&amp;_tval=1&amp;_tlbl=Position%3A+1\" target=\"_self\">Facebook launched Home at a press event</a>&nbsp;on Thursday. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, described it as a way to redesign the phone for \"people first,\" rather than the apps that dominate the rest of the smartphone universe.</p>
<p>If you'd like to try out Home, you have two options: wait until April 12 and download it from Google Play, or buy the HTC First for $99, the first phone with Home embedded within it. If you choose to download, be aware that Home will only run on the HTC One X, HTC One X+, Samsung's Galaxy S3 and Note 2, and the forthcoming HTC One and Galaxy S4, Facebook said.</p>
<p><span class=\"embedded-Media-image img-caption-c\">
<img src=\"http://readwrite.com/files/IMG_20130404_114304.jpg\" style=\"\" />
</span>
</p>
<p>Facebook allowed the press to look at both the HTC First as well as phones running the Home software following the press event. While many weren't allowed to touch the phone, product managers encouraged me to play around with the downloadable Home app running on a Galaxy S3. I also tested the First, albeit briefly.</p>
<h2>Home Feels Like Home</h2>
<p>Home interjects itself from the first moment you pick up your phone. On the unlock screen, Home displays the first entry in what Facebook calls its Cover Feed: full-screen, vertically-oriented photos with text from a status message overlaid. Swiping left and right brings up new entries.</p>
<p>You can think of Cover Feed as an Instapaper-like view of your News Feed, emphasizing photos and status messages. You won't see video, group posts, or even ads — yet. But Facebook promises almost monthly updates, so plan on additional features to be added in the future. Who wants to bet that ads will one day be one of those additions?</p>
<p><span class=\"embedded-Media-image img-caption-c\">
<img src=\"http://readwrite.com/files/IMG_20130404_114718.jpg\" style=\"\" />
<span class=\"embedded-Media-image-caption\">Hey! Apps! Nope, they're shortcuts.</span>
</span>
</p>
<p>Clearly, this \"home\" slice of \"Home\" is the easiest to use, and the most enjoyable. Even if you have a just a few seconds, you can quickly swipe left and right to bring up new updates, double-tap an image to Like it, and add a comment by clicking the icon at the bottom of the screen. Sliding from image to image was effortless, at least on both the First and the Note II.</p>
<p>Note that this is Facebook's domain: there are no widgets, no app shortcuts, and no Google search bar at the top of the screen. If you want those, you'll have to work for it.</p>
<p>Home also displays a small, circular icon at the bottom of the screen with an image of your face inside it, as a starting point for further navigation. If you want to launch a Web browser, swipe right; swipe left to launch Facebook Messenger, and swipe up to access your \"apps\".</p>
<p>Swiping right brings up the stock Web browser — no problems there. Swiping left brings up Messenger, where you can text and message your friends. If you're on a cellular connection, those Messages will be sent via SMS, which highlights them in blue. (Or so the product-demo person at the event told me. No, I don't see why it couldn't send Facebook messages via cellular data, either.)</p>
<p>But Facebook Home also includes both notifications and something called \"Chat Heads,\" which can follow you from app to app. If you happen to be listening to Spotify, for example, and your friend pings you, their \"head\" — a circular icon with their picture — shows up and you can begin chatting. You can engage in multiple conversations with different friends via different \"tabs,\" each keyed to a chat head.</p>

<span class=\"embedded-Media-image-caption\">Messenger looks the same.</span>
</span>
</p>
<p>Home also sends you notifications for friends who Like your posts, which will pop up on your screen. Home has a nifty trick for dismissing them all at once: just hold down your finger on the screen, and they'll converge like hungry fish. They then can be \"thrown\" off of the screen.&nbsp;</p>

<span class=\"embedded-Media-image-caption\">&quot;Chat Heads&quot;</span>
</span>
</p>
<p>I suppose some may be nonplussed by chat and notification icons popping up randomly, but most Facebook addicts will probably love these features. It's when you bring apps into the equation that things get a little awkward.</p>
<h2>You Can Log Off, But You Can (Almost) Never Leave</h2>
<p>Why? Because accessing other apps implies that you want to look away from Facebook. Facebook doesn't want you to leave; part of the value Facebook ascribes to itself is its engagement with the user. When you swipe up to access apps, you don't really access \"apps\" — a small window of \"shortcuts\" to the apps themselves appear. And at the top of the window is the familiar \"status\" and \"photo\" shortcuts.</p>
<p>In other words, you haven't actually left Home; you're just in its antechamber.</p>
<p>Home does allow you to access your full list of apps, arranged alphabetically. At the very bottom is a \"More\" icon. Clicking that takes you back to your home screen — except this time, you're within the Android/TouchWiz/HTC Sense environment. Congratulations — you've escaped.</p>
<p>As you might have figured out, Home wants to monopolize your attention, so that any other function your phone wishes to perform — such as notifying you of an email, for example — gets treated as an intrusion.</p>
<p><span class=\"embedded-Media-image img-caption-c\">

</span>
&nbsp;</p>
<h2>No E-Mail For You!</h2>
<p>This is where experience on phones like the HTC First diverge from phones built around the Home app. The First notifies users of incoming emails (or Google Talk requests, as I saw) via notifications. On a phone which uses a Home app, the Android status bar at the top of the screen does the same thing, before being banished by Home. Functionally, it's almost the same thing. But inside Home, you tend to forget about the \"outside world\" of Android.</p>
<p>This, to me, feels like the \"catch\" of Facebook Home. Chief executive Mark Zuckerberg was asked whether he felt that Google would tolerate Home, since it essentially domnates the screen real estate that Google has traditionally regarded as its own.</p>
<p>It's \"theoretically possible,\" Zuckerberg said, that Google would go back on its \"promise of openness\". Zuckerberg also described Apple as a partner, but iOS as a \"very controlled environment\" — the implication being that Home on top of iOS is a pipe dream.</p>
<p>Google representatives said that they consider Home to be a \"launcher,\" a way of recasting Google's Android. Does it bury Google content to the point that it's hidden? I think so. So far, it doesn't matter: “The Android platform has spurred the development of hundreds of different types of devices,\" Google said in a statement. \"This latest device demonstrates the openness and flexibility that has made Android so popular.”</p>
<p>But it's significant, I think, that Facebook has already shown that its mobile apps can be downloaded outside the Google Play store. If in fact Google tries to ban Facebook, Facebook may be able to pursue alternative means of distribution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should you download Home? Absolutely. You'll need to most recent updates to Facebook and Messenger to do so. But make sure that when you launch Home, you choose the option to run Home once, to try it out. Home will blow you away the first time you use it, but I think its appeal will wane for all but the most social users.</p><div class=\"feedflare\">

<p>As you might have figured out, Home wants to monopolize your attention, so that any other function your phone wishes to perform — such as notifying you of an email, for example — gets treated as an intrusion.</p>

<h2>No E-Mail For You!</h2>
<p>This is where experience on phones like the HTC First diverge from phones built around the Home app. The First notifies users of incoming emails (or Google Talk requests, as I saw) via notifications. On a phone which uses a Home app, the Android status bar at the top of the screen does the same thing, before being banished by Home. Functionally, it's almost the same thing. But inside Home, you tend to forget about the \"outside world\" of Android.</p>
<p>This, to me, feels like the \"catch\" of Facebook Home. Chief executive Mark Zuckerberg was asked whether he felt that Google would tolerate Home, since it essentially domnates the screen real estate that Google has traditionally regarded as its own.</p>
<p>It's \"theoretically possible,\" Zuckerberg said, that Google would go back on its \"promise of openness\". Zuckerberg also described Apple as a partner, but iOS as a \"very controlled environment\" — the implication being that Home on top of iOS is a pipe dream.</p>
<p>Google representatives said that they consider Home to be a \"launcher,\" a way of recasting Google's Android. Does it bury Google content to the point that it's hidden? I think so. So far, it doesn't matter: “The Android platform has spurred the development of hundreds of different types of devices,\" Google said in a statement. \"This latest device demonstrates the openness and flexibility that has made Android so popular.”</p>
<p>But it's significant, I think, that Facebook has already shown that its mobile apps can be downloaded outside the Google Play store. If in fact Google tries to ban Facebook, Facebook may be able to pursue alternative means of distribution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should you download Home? Absolutely. You'll need to most recent updates to Facebook and Messenger to do so. But make sure that when you launch Home, you choose the option to run Home once, to try it out. Home will blow you away the first time you use it, but I think its appeal will wane for all but the most social users.</p><div class=\"feedflare\">

<h2 class=\"p2\">The Hype Was Heavy</h2>
<p class=\"p1\">Would it be new \"skin\" software designed to put Facebook front and center on any Android device? Or an actual device in of itself - the rumor mill suggested HTC - built from the ground up to feature the social networking giant. Or would it be something completely new and unexpected?</p>
<p class=\"p1\">Everyone wanted to know. Heck, the local newsradio station - not known for its tech savvy - gushed breathlessly about the event - right before talking about President Obama's visit to the Bay Area.</p>
<p class=\"p1\">But when Mark Zuckerberg walked on stage, it became clear we're talking about both! \"Today we're finally going to talk about the Facebook phone,\" Zuckerberg said. But that phone, the HTC First, is really just a reference model for the best integration of the Facebook Home software that can be downloaded onto any modern Android phone (starting April 12).</p>
<h2 class=\"p2\">What Is Facebook Home?</h2>
<p class=\"p1\">According to Zuckerberg, Facebook Home consists of a few key capabilities designed to put people, not apps, first. \"Today, our phones are designed aroundapps, not people\" Zuckerberg said. \"And we want to flip that around.\" He compared the change to adding Newsfeed to Facebook's website, where people started consuming about twice as much content overnight, he said. \"We want to bring this experience right to your phone, and deliver it to as many poeple as possible.\"</p>
<p class=\"p1\">There are three key components:&nbsp;Cover Feed, Chat Heads and Notifications.</p>
<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Cover Feed:</strong> Replacing the home and/or lock screen of an Android device, it gives you an immersive experience from the moment you turn on your phone, said Adam Mosseri, Facebook's director of product. Instead of seeing a clock and maybe a snippet of a notification, you see your Facebook Open Graph stories with large images cycling across the screen. News shares, status updates (use the poster's cover photo as the background) are visible right from the get got. You can do a long press to see the whole picture or swipe to get to the next one. You can even add comments right from the home screen, seen below.</p>
<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"embedded-Media-image img-caption-c\">
<img src=\"http://readwrite.com/files/fb_cover_feed_0.jpg\" style=\"\" />
</span>
</p>
<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Chat Heads:</strong> These little round bubbles with the images of your friends shown below are the metaphor for Facebook Home's way of keeping you up to date on what your friends are saying. Incorporating Facebook messaging and texting, you just tap on the Head to join the conversation. (Group conversations smuch all the participant's pictures into the bubble, slightly awkwardly.) The key here is that Chat Heads show up everywhere on the phone, not just in a dedicated app. They're always available - the little Heads show up in the corner of the screen no matter what else you're doing, and follow along when you move to a new app. (You can just flick them away if you want to get rid of them.)</p>
<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"embedded-Media-image img-caption-c\">
<img src=\"http://readwrite.com/files/fb_chatheads.jpg\" style=\"\" />
</span>
</p>
<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Notifications:</strong> If Chat Heads are about connecting to what's important to you, Zuckerberg said, Notifications are there to make sure you don't miss critical information - along with the name and face of the person who's sending you the message. Unfortunately, with the download version at least, Facebook Home will not support notifications of emails, but you can still use the native Android notification bar. It's not as pretty, but it's still effective - something may not matter to high-school kids, but it may to the older professionals who also make up a big part of Facebook's member base.</p>
<p class=\"p1\">Finally, Facebook Home adds a new app launcher, for when you still want to use your phone the old-fashioned way. Apps are really important too, so we wanted to make it just as easy to get to your apps. The app launcher is just one swipe away from your home or lock screen.</p>
<p class=\"p1\">Many, but not all, of these features can be switched on or off, the company said.</p>
<h2 class=\"p2\">How Big A Deal Is Facebook Home?</h2>
<p class=\"p1\">While Facebook home is not a complete mobile operating system, it's not some lightweight app, either. \"We're not building a phone, and we're not building an operating system, but we're also building something a lot deeper than just an app,\" Zuckerberg said. \"We wanted this to feel like system software, not just an app that your run. We feel like theres a higher bar for that…\"</p>
<p class=\"p1\">That's critical, because people spend <em>a lot</em> of time on Facebook on their mobile phones. Some 20% of the time people spend on their smartphones is spent with Facebook - 25% if you include Instragram, the company said. And that's three times as much as with any other app.</p>
<p class=\"p1\">Still, while Zuckerberg claimed that people look at Facebook 10-12 times a day, they look at the home screen of their phone <em>100 times</em> a day. Facebook Home brings the social network much closer to the user - and could be expected to seriously up Facebook's engagment time for those who use it.</p>
<p class=\"p1\">It also expands on Facebook's Mobile First mantra to what Zuckerberg called \"Mobile Best.\" \"We think this is the best version of Facebook there is.\"</p>
<h2 class=\"p2\">The Facebook Phone</h2>
<p class=\"p1\">Facebook Home will be available for free download from the Google Play store on April 12, but that's only part of the story. Facebook Home is also the HTC First (seen on the left, below), available the same day for $99.99 exclusively from AT&amp;T - pre-orders start today.</p>
<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"embedded-Media-image img-caption-c\">
<img src=\"http://readwrite.com/files/photo-4.JPG\" style=\"\" />
</span>
</p>
<p class=\"p1\">As the first phone with Facebook Home built in, the HTC First offers deeper integration than the downloadable version. The key, Zuckerberg said, is that users don't have to download anything or sign in to anything to get started. In addition, the built-in integration means Facebook Home can (unlike the downloadable version) incorporate notifications from other apps, such as email or Spotify. The email issue, particularly, will be a big deal to some people.</p>
<h2 class=\"p2\">What's Next For Facebook Home?</h2>
<p class=\"p1\">The April 12 launch date is only the beginning for Facebook Home. Zuckerberg promised that like all Facebook software, it will be updated monthly (not yearly like mobile operating systems). Updates will likely expand Cover Feed to include video, group joins, friending stories and other actions.</p>
<p class=\"p1\">Another thing to expect? Ads. While Zuckerberg said there would not be ads in Cover Feed at launch, he didn't dispute a question that they could be added at a later date.</p>
<p class=\"p1\">It also makes sense to expect more smartphones with Facebook Home built in. The company made no mention of an exclusive arrangement with HTC or AT&amp;T. The company also promised a tablet version of Facebook home within the next few months. As for a version of Facebook Home for the iPhone and iPad, Zuckerberg was non-committal. That will require working with Apple, he said, in ways that talking to Google wasn't necessary to do the Android version.</p>
<p class=\"p1\">And that could actually make some waves in the mobile platform wars. \"I actually think this is really good for Android,\" Zuckerberg said. Even though there are more Android phones out there, he explained, a lot of people do their best work on iphone first. \"This could bring more innovation to Android.\"</p>
<p class=\"p1\">Facebook will be working to lead that. \"This is a deeply technical problem, and its also a deeply social problem,\" Zuckerberg said, adding that his company is uniquely positioned to deal with that combination.</p>

"<p class=\"p1\">When it comes to video games, the death knell is rung loudly and frequently.&nbsp;In an industry so intrinsically tied to technological innovation, we won't stop hearing any time soon about what former trend or gaming mainstay has its head on the chopping block. The most recent forecast from worried gaming circles: original, story-driven, triple-A games are too bloated and risky to survive in a cheaper, stripped-down and more mobile world.&nbsp;Unfortunately,&nbsp;there's a lot of evidence backing this claim up.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"p1\">Case in point: <a href=\"http://www.bioshockinfinite.com/?RET=&amp;ag=true\" target=\"_blank\">BioShock Infinite</a>, which hit shelves on March 26 to universal acclaim. An artistic endeavor that cost anywhere between $100 to $200 million (<a href=\"http://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/the-cost-of-columbia-ken-levine-contradicts-claims-of-a-200-million-bioshock-infinite-budget/\">developer Irrational Games won't confirm</a>) to make and market on top of almost five years of development to fine tune it to near perfection, it's the second original installment in the BioShock series.</p>
<p class=\"p1\">But it's not a sequel. A game unto itself, it continues the trend of creator and writer Ken Levine's visions of thought-provoking period pieces. This one happens to mash a 1912 setting with pop-culture aesthetics, sensitive American history (<a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/2/4170256/bioshock-infinite-making-great-art-from-americas-racist-past-and\" target=\"_blank\">like racism and eugenics</a>) and moral philosophy into what is being called easily one of the greatest games ever made. In other words, while the first BioShock was a coming-of-age moment for video games as an art form back in 2007, Infinite can be viewed as the epitome of the modern, blockbuster <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_game\" target=\"_blank\">\"art game,\"</a> a term usually reserved for offbeat indie titles but one that aptly fits the murky, morality-infused waters that only BioShock treads.</p>
<p class=\"p1\">Despite all the accolades, BioShock Infinite might be the last of its kind. A number of factors are contributing to this outcome, but principally the struggle is between the money that can be made versus the amount of time, effort and studio dollars invested. Early sales reports from the United Kingdom say that despite the fever pitch engulfing the gaming community, <a href=\"http://www.digitalspy.com/gaming/news/a469845/bioshock-infinite-is-all-format-number-one-biggest-launch-of-series.html\" target=\"_blank\">BioShock Infinite still didn't outsell the new Tomb Raider at launch.</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"p1\">The gaming landscape is allowing independent developers to gain recognition easier and faster than ever before, mobile and Facebook games are generating more and more revenue, and a <a style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\" href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2013/03/28/ouya-hands-on/\" target=\"_blank\">$99 console has Kickstarted its way into the hands of consumers</a>. So&nbsp;there might not be a place for an artistically grand game with a $100 million plus budget, a $60 consumer price tag and a narrower target audience. Well, at least one that doesn't have a number tagged on the end of its name.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class=\"p1\">In The Next Console Generation, Sequels Will Sell</h2>
<p class=\"p1\">Of course, a handful of big-budget, triple-A games are slated for the end of the current generation of consoles this year. And 2014 and 2015 hold the promise of a slew of new games for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox 'Durango,' as its called at the moment.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"p1\">But a lot of these titles - and a healthy chunk of what <a href=\"http://www.polygon.com/2013/2/20/4008722/ps4-reveal-details\">Sony debuted at its PS4 event in February</a> - were sequels within established franchises that are only confirmed and shown off because publishers know they will sell.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"p1\">After all, your annual Call of Duty or Assassin's Creed take an international team of developers <a href=\"http://www.polygon.com/2013/4/2/4173590/assassins-creed-fans-will-tell-us-when-theyre-tired-of-annual\">only a year to churn out</a> and still make hundreds of millions of dollars in sales (Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 made $500 million in its first day, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/9683341/Call-of-duty-Black-Ops-II-sales-hit-500-million-in-first-24-hours.html\">making it the largest entertainment launch ever</a>).</p>
<p class=\"p1\">These games still cost tens of millions of dollars to make, but are offering increasingly less innovation with each iteration so the developers can put them on shelves every fall and keep turning those profits. However, to call BioShock a franchise - and Infinite a sequel - is to ignore its studio Irrational Games' mission, which is&nbsp;delivering&nbsp;unique, orginal, epic stories that constantly push the medium. <a href=\"http://www.polygon.com/game/bioshock-infinite/2779\" target=\"_blank\">Given the rave reviews</a>, the game pulls that off well.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"p1\">So it's not quite the case that BioShock Infinite will be the last \"art game\" as it is likely that it could be the last big-budget one. As the money begins to move away from console games in general, what's&nbsp;left for triple-A titles will naturally funnel to profitable franchises and not to unique, original gambles like BioShock.</p>
<p class=\"p1\">BioShock was such a gamble in fact that Levine, just to get the series off the ground last decade, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=Efv9Mgwk8SU\" target=\"_blank\">had to pitch&nbsp;the original for three years</a> before getting a publisher, Take-Two Interactive, to put some money behind it. That kind of attitude will become less and less common as the financial jaws begin to close in on console game publishing.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class=\"p1\">Follow The Money: Facebook And Mobile</h2>
<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"embedded-Media-image img-caption-c\">
<img src=\"http://readwrite.com/files/candy%20crush.jpg\" style=\"\" />
</span>
Hardcore gamers scoff at the shallowness of Angry Birds, the manipulative tactics of Facebook games, and the move towards a mobile-dominated industry offering smaller satisfactions. But the sad truth is that that's where the money is.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"p1\">Console sales are tanking. NPD Group reported last month that <a href=\"http://www.geekwire.com/2013/npd-video-game-sales-fall-25-percent-february/\" target=\"_blank\">console sales fell 36% in February</a> from the same time last year (though you could attribute some of that to consumers holding out for Sony and Microsoft's next generation), and Nintendo's&nbsp;<a href=\"http://allthingsd.com/20130315/wii-u-sales-still-lousy/\" target=\"_blank\">Wii U has been hurting of late</a>. As for game sales, those fell 25%.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"p1\"><strong>(See also:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://readwrite.com/2013/03/04/game-consoles-already-dead-developers-know-it#feed=/author/markhachman\" target=\"_blank\">Game Consoles Are Already Dead, And Developers Know It</a>)</strong></p>
<p class=\"p1\">Compare that to how Facebook game developers have been doing and you can start to see the shift. Makers of Facebook games like <a href=\"http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-57576361-93/facebook-game-developers-generated-$2.8-billion-in-2012/\" target=\"_blank\">Candy Crush generated a total of $2.8 billion in 2012 alone</a>. These are free games developed with the sole purpose of making you spend more time on Facebook and driving you, through addiction, to pony up more money than any traditional console game could ever milk out of you.</p>
<p class=\"p1\">As for mobile games, <a href=\"http://www.joystiq.com/2013/03/30/npd-digital-game-sales-growing-year-over-year-33-percent/\" target=\"_blank\">they generated $2.1 billion last year</a> and will keep growing alongside digitally sold titles and downloadable content. These are the new money makers, typically using a free model that sucks players dry&nbsp;like for instance Real Racing 3, described as <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/gamelife/2013/04/ea-mobile-real-racing-3/\" target=\"_blank\">\"F1 meets Farmville\"</a> because of its microtransaction system that forces you to pay every 30 minutes to keep playing.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"p1\">The final frontier to collapse into the gaming chasm is the indie community, which has undergone a bit of a transformation ever since the big hardware companies gained the ability to sell&nbsp;independently&nbsp;developed titles over their online marketplaces at prices as cheap as $5 and $10.</p>
<p class=\"p1\">The robust new market for quirky, well-designed games from small teams raises an interesting question:&nbsp;if indie games can provide a thought-provoking, philosophical and emotional interactive experience, what are we to lose in chopping off the&nbsp;triple-A limb if not simply scale and scope?</p>
<h2 class=\"p1\">The Indie Game Revolution&nbsp;</h2>
<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"embedded-Media-image img-caption-c\">
<img src=\"http://readwrite.com/files/joruney.jpg\" style=\"\" />
</span>
At this year's <a href=\"http://www.gdconf.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Game Developer's Conference</a> that took place in San Francisco last week, downloadable game Journey&nbsp;became the first independent title to win the Game of the Year award. That would be on top of the game's other multiple game&nbsp;of the year awards and its <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/gamelife/2012/12/video-games-grammys-journey/\" target=\"_blank\">Best Soundtrack Grammy nomination, a first for the medium</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"p1\">Journey has been hailed as <a href=\"http://www.gamesradar.com/why-journey-one-greatest-games-ever-made/\" target=\"_blank\">one of the greatest, most emotional storytelling experiences in modern gaming</a>, and yet it clocks in at about three hours of playtime and only costs $15 to download to your PS3. The concept is simple: play as an unnamed, cloaked figure that must travel to the peak of mountain. Yet it has a unique mechanism, as most indie games do, that allows you to join up with an anonymous player from anywhere in the world who can serendipitously enter your game at any time.</p>
<p class=\"p1\">This kind of thought-provoking take on gaming concepts is part of the canon of \"art games,\" a genre getting more and more recognition from mainstream markets. These titles are also fulfilling a need for deep, meaningful games in a world where the next BioShock Infinite is looking less and less likely. They're just doing it on a smaller scale and for less money.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"p1\">“Like it or not, we’re not the Clash anymore. We’re Green Day,\" said Andy Schatz, an indie game designer, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/01/arts/video-games/game-developers-conference-celebrates-indie-creators.html\" target=\"_blank\">in an interview with The New York Times' Chris Sullentrop</a>. A clever&nbsp;analogy&nbsp;and one that accurately describes the indie game market as it's evolved from fighting the traditional system to being embraced by it.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"p1\">This trend bodes well for the future of what was once a peripheral community that could barely get its creations on the market, but is also yet another reason why the industry may not sustain projects as bold and expensive as BioShock in the future.</p>
<h2 class=\"p1\">The Ground Is Shifting</h2>
<p>To deny there are artistic, big-budget games on the horizon would be to ignore the work of a handful of forward-thinking studios. Naughty Dog is producing<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKcwNIPiGKc\" target=\"_blank\"> The Last of Us</a>, a post-apocalyptic game that puts you in the role of protecting a young girl amid vicious survival combat, and French studio Quantic Dream is making Beyond Two Souls, the first ever title to use full motion capture to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QZN2IC0vOo\" target=\"_blank\">transform an actress (Ellen Page, in this case) into a video game character</a> while keeping real-world likeness&nbsp;completely&nbsp;intact.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These games are doing what BioShock Infinite did: building off a previous success (Naughty Dog with its <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncharted\" target=\"_blank\">Uncharted series</a> and Quantic Dream with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_Rain\" target=\"_blank\">Heavy Rain</a>) and trying something new and envelope pushing. But in many ways they are also maneuvering the line between a bold step forward for the medium and something that still resembles a marketable blockbuster-style psychological thriller.</p>
<p>BioShock's appeal comes primarily from the way it feels like a complete realization of artistic vision, one painstakingly crafted over many years fraught with <a href=\"http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/175574/\" target=\"_blank\">uncertainty, revision and a number of high-profile employee departures</a>. It's a mix of ideas screaming to be translated into film, but likely will never get there because of <a href=\"http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-03-12-ken-levine-personally-killed-off-the-bioshock-film-heres-why\" target=\"_blank\">how impossible it would be</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"p1\">\"For all I know, I'll never get to work on another big $60 title - or the equivalent of that. Maybe there will be no economy for that. Who knows?\" Levine says to nonfiction author and game critic <a href=\"http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/9097228/tom-bissell-interviews-ken-levine-mind-bioshock\" target=\"_blank\">Tom Bissell in a Grantland interview</a>. \"…I'm pretty confident that talented people will be able to work on quality products. I just don't know exactly how.\" Admitting it's the 'how' that's up in the air is the first step. Figuring out what to do next is the&nbsp;important&nbsp;part.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"p1\">For those who have their hands on BioShock Infinite, and to the many who may likely pick it up in the near future, savor the game's moments and all that went into creating its floating city&nbsp;environment&nbsp;and the one-of-a-kind feel it evokes. It could be the last sign of a dying breed.&nbsp;</p>

(description nil "<p class=\"p1\">When it comes to video games, the death knell is rung loudly and frequently.&nbsp;In an industry so intrinsically tied to technological innovation, we won't stop hearing any time soon about what former trend or gaming mainstay has its head on the chopping block. The most recent forecast from worried gaming circles: original, story-driven, triple-A games are too bloated and risky to survive in a cheaper, stripped-down and more mobile world.&nbsp;Unfortunately,&nbsp;there's a lot of evidence backing this claim up.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"p1\">Case in point: <a href=\"http://www.bioshockinfinite.com/?RET=&amp;ag=true\" target=\"_blank\">BioShock Infinite</a>, which hit shelves on March 26 to universal acclaim. An artistic endeavor that cost anywhere between $100 to $200 million (<a href=\"http://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/the-cost-of-columbia-ken-levine-contradicts-claims-of-a-200-million-bioshock-infinite-budget/\">developer Irrational Games won't confirm</a>) to make and market on top of almost five years of development to fine tune it to near perfection, it's the second original installment in the BioShock series.</p>
<p class=\"p1\">But it's not a sequel. A game unto itself, it continues the trend of creator and writer Ken Levine's visions of thought-provoking period pieces. This one happens to mash a 1912 setting with pop-culture aesthetics, sensitive American history (<a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/2/4170256/bioshock-infinite-making-great-art-from-americas-racist-past-and\" target=\"_blank\">like racism and eugenics</a>) and moral philosophy into what is being called easily one of the greatest games ever made.

<p class=\"p1\">The gaming landscape is allowing independent developers to gain recognition easier and faster than ever before, mobile and Facebook games are generating more and more revenue, and a <a style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\" href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2013/03/28/ouya-hands-on/\" target=\"_blank\">$99 console has Kickstarted its way into the hands of consumers</a>. So&nbsp;there might not be a place for an artistically grand game with a $100 million plus budget, a $60 consumer price tag and a narrower target audience. Well, at least one that doesn't have a number tagged on the end of its name.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class=\"p1\">In The Next Console Generation, Sequels Will Sell</h2>
<p class=\"p1\">Of course, a handful of big-budget, triple-A games are slated for the end of the current generation of consoles this year. And 2014 and 2015 hold the promise of a slew of new games for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox 'Durango,' as its called at the moment.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"p1\">But a lot of these titles - and a healthy chunk of what <a href=\"http://www.polygon.com/2013/2/20/4008722/ps4-reveal-details\">Sony debuted at its PS4 event in February</a> - were sequels within established franchises that are only confirmed and shown off because publishers know they will sell.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"p1\">After all, your annual Call of Duty or Assassin's Creed take an international team of developers <a href=\"http://www.polygon.com/2013/4/2/4173590/assassins-creed-fans-will-tell-us-when-theyre-tired-of-annual\">only a year to churn out</a> and still make hundreds of millions of dollars in sales (Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 made $500 million in its first day, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/9683341/Call-of-duty-Black-Ops-II-sales-hit-500-million-in-first-24-hours.html\">making it the largest entertainment launch ever</a>).</p>
<p class=\"p1\">These games still cost tens of millions of dollars to make, but are offering increasingly less innovation with each iteration so the developers can put them on shelves every fall and keep turning those profits. However, to call BioShock a franchise - and Infinite a sequel - is to ignore its studio Irrational Games' mission, which is&nbsp;delivering&nbsp;unique, orginal, epic stories that constantly push the medium. <a href=\"http://www.polygon.com/game/bioshock-infinite/2779\" target=\"_blank\">Given the rave reviews</a>, the game pulls that off well.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=\"p1\">BioShock was such a gamble in fact that Levine, just to get the series off the ground last decade, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=Efv9Mgwk8SU\" target=\"_blank\">had to pitch&nbsp;the original for three years</a> before getting a publisher, Take-Two Interactive, to put some money behind it.

<p class=\"p1\">Compare that to how Facebook game developers have been doing and you can start to see the shift. Makers of Facebook games like <a href=\"http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-57576361-93/facebook-game-developers-generated-$2.8-billion-in-2012/\" target=\"_blank\">Candy Crush generated a total of $2.8 billion in 2012 alone</a>.

<p class=\"p1\">As for mobile games, <a href=\"http://www.joystiq.com/2013/03/30/npd-digital-game-sales-growing-year-over-year-33-percent/\" target=\"_blank\">they generated $2.1 billion last year</a> and will keep growing alongside digitally sold titles and downloadable content. These are the new money makers, typically using a free model that sucks players dry&nbsp;like for instance Real Racing 3, described as <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/gamelife/2013/04/ea-mobile-real-racing-3/\" target=\"_blank\">\"F1 meets Farmville\"</a> because of its microtransaction system that forces you to pay every 30 minutes to keep playing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>BioShock's appeal comes primarily from the way it feels like a complete realization of artistic vision, one painstakingly crafted over many years fraught with <a href=\"http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/175574/\" target=\"_blank\">uncertainty, revision and a number of high-profile employee departures</a>. It's a mix of ideas screaming to be translated into film, but likely will never get there because of <a href=\"http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-03-12-ken-levine-personally-killed-off-the-bioshock-film-heres-why\" target=\"_blank\">how impossible it would be</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"p1\">\"For all I know, I'll never get to work on another big $60 title - or the equivalent of that. Maybe there will be no economy for that. Who knows?\" Levine says to nonfiction author and game critic <a href=\"http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/9097228/tom-bissell-interviews-ken-levine-mind-bioshock\" target=\"_blank\">Tom Bissell in a Grantland interview</a>. \"…I'm pretty confident that talented people will be able to work on quality products. I just don't know exactly how.\" Admitting it's the 'how' that's up in the air is the first step. Figuring out what to do next is the&nbsp;important&nbsp;part.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=\"p1\">For those who have their hands on BioShock Infinite, and to the many who may likely pick it up in the near future, savor the game's moments and all that went into creating its floating city&nbsp;environment&nbsp;and the one-of-a-kind feel it evokes. It could be the last sign of a dying breed.&nbsp;</p>

"<p>It's been five months since Timothy Ferriss <a href=\"http://readwrite.com/2012/11/29/is-bittorrent-the-future-of-book-publishing-tim-ferriss-is-banking-on-it\">launched his bold experiment</a> in modern publishing. The best-selling author bypassed the \"big six\" publishers, signed with Amazon and, as if that weren't unconventional enough, partnered with <a href=\"http://bittorrent.com\" target=\"_blank\">BitTorrent</a> to help promote his new book, <em>The 4-Hour Chef</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The whole thing seemed almost designed to generate press, which it did. But now for the important part: Did the experiment work?</p>
<p>It sure looks that way. Despite being boycotted by Barnes and Noble and other bricks and mortar retailers, Ferriss's book has sold over 250,000 copies and landed on all the major bestseller lists.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, Ferriss is a well-known and established author, which helps. So does signing with Amazon, which is powerful enough to send the U.S.'s biggest brick-and-mortar book retailer into a book-banning fury.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But as mighty as Amazon is, being banned from big-box retailers is a serious handicap. To compensate, Ferriss had to forge some unexpected partnerships, such as with smaller retailers and Panera Bread, the sandwich shop chain. He also teamed up with BitTorrent, through which he published a 680-megabyte bundle of bonus content, including behind-the-scenes videos, a sample chapter and author notes.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Can BitTorrent Actually Drive Sales?&nbsp;</h2>
<p>\"To be honest, I was initially skeptical about how many sales would result from BitTorrent,\" says Ferriss. &nbsp;\"After all, that's where people go to get stuff for free, right?\"</p>
<p>Indeed, most people associate the P2P filesharing protocol with pirating movies, music, software and yes, books. BitTorrent, Inc has been busy trying to shed that reputation, in part by partnering with well-known content creators like Ferriss, even if they're somewhat nervous about the idea.&nbsp;</p>
<p>\"It turns out that I couldn't have been more wrong,\" he says. \"The click-through rates from BitTorrent to Amazon were higher than anything I've ever seen through paid advertising. &nbsp;Orders of magnitude higher.\"</p>
<p>More than 880,000 people have clicked through to <em>The 4-Hour Chef</em>'s Amazon landing page. Amazon doesn't offer its authors conversion metrics, so it's hard to say how many of those people actually purchased the book. But it's an impressive amount of exposure. BitTorrent also sent nearly 300,000 people to the book's video trailer on YouTube and over 327,000 to Ferriss' website. Not bad.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Piracy Question&nbsp;</h2>
<p>But there's an elephant in the room: piracy. Just as easily as they can grab Ferriss' <em>4-Hour Chef</em> promotional bundle on BitTorrent, users can find pirated copies of all three of his books.&nbsp;</p>
<p>\"If someone is willing to spend time finding a legit bootleg source and reading a DRM-broken hard-to-read copy of my book on a computer screen not intended for reading, just to avoid spending $12 or so, they weren't ever my core audience to begin with,\" Ferriss says. \"If I get them, it's nothing but bonus points.\"</p>
<p>So, the Amazon/BitTorrent publishing hack seems to be working, for Ferriss at least. There are lessons to be learned here, but with the usual dose of caution. In the same way that Radiohead didn't single-handedly make \"pay what you want\" a viable model for all musicians, Ferriss's example is going to be of limited value to new authors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still, it demonstrates the potential of today's platforms and protocols when it comes to one-upping long-entrenched players and leveling the playing field a bit. We all can't be Tim Ferriss, just like <a href=\"http://readwrite.com/2013/04/02/justin-timberlake-proves-streaming-isnt-a-death-wish-for-music-sales\">we all can't be Justin Timberlake</a>.

<p>Update: The event has ended. <a href=\"http://newsroom.fb.com/News/597/Introducing-Home\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook announced</a> both an application layer for Android with a variety of features as well as a smartphone called the HTC First, that will be available exclusively from AT&amp;T on April 12th for $99.99. Home will be available on select Android devices starting April 12th including the One X and One X+, Samsung Galaxy S3 and Galaxy Note II. When the Galaxy S4 is available later in April, it will support Home as well as the HTC One.</p>
<p><span class=\"embedded-Media-image img-caption-c\">
<img src=\"http://readwrite.com/files/fb_cover_feed.jpg\" style=\"\" />
</span>
</p>
<p>Facebook Home is an application layer that is placed on top of Android. It is essentially a new user interface, also known as a \"skin\" in much the same way that HTC does Sense or Samsung does Touchwiz for Android.</p>
<p><span class=\"embedded-Media-image img-caption-c\">
<img src=\"http://readwrite.com/files/fb_home_devices.jpg\" style=\"\" />
</span>
</p>
<p>There are four main features to Facebook Home:</p>
<p><strong>Cover feed</strong> -- According to Facebook: \"Cover feed replaces the lock screen and home screen. It's a window into what's happening with your friends - friends finishing a bike race, your family sharing a meal or an article about your favorite sports team. These are the beautiful, immersive experiences that you get through Home.\"</p>
<p><strong>Chat heads</strong> -- \"With chat heads you can keep chatting with friends even when you're using other apps. When friends send you messages, a chat head appears with your friend's face, so you see exactly who you're chatting with. Messages reach you no matter what you're doing - whether you're checking email, browsing the web, or listening to music.\"</p>
<p><strong>Notifications</strong> -- \"Cover feed is great for seeing everything going on in the world. But when something happens that's more important and directed at you, like a friend posting on your timeline, you'll receive notifications with their profile pictures.&nbsp;To open notifications, just tap them. And if you don't want to deal with them right now, you can just swipe to hide them and keep flipping through cover feed until you want them back.\"</p>
<p><strong>Apps</strong> -- Facebook will have its own apps drawer, similar to iOS and Android.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Update: The event has ended. <a href=\"http://newsroom.fb.com/News/597/Introducing-Home\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook announced</a> both an application layer for Android with a variety of features as well as a smartphone called the HTC First, that will be available exclusively from AT&amp;T on April 12th for $99.99. Home will be available on select Android devices starting April 12th including the One X and One X+, Samsung Galaxy S3 and Galaxy Note II. When the Galaxy S4 is available later in April, it will support Home as well as the HTC One.</p>

</p>
<p>Facebook Home is an application layer that is placed on top of Android. It is essentially a new user interface, also known as a \"skin\" in much the same way that HTC does Sense or Samsung does Touchwiz for Android.</p>
<p><span class=\"embedded-Media-image img-caption-c\">
				<img src=\"http://readwrite.com/files/fb_home_devices.jpg\" style=\"\" />
			</span>
</p>
<p>There are four main features to Facebook Home:</p>
<p><strong>Cover feed</strong> -- According to Facebook: \"Cover feed replaces the lock screen and home screen. It's a window into what's happening with your friends - friends finishing a bike race, your family sharing a meal or an article about your favorite sports team. These are the beautiful, immersive experiences that you get through Home.\"</p>
<p><strong>Chat heads</strong> -- \"With chat heads you can keep chatting with friends even when you're using other apps. When friends send you messages, a chat head appears with your friend's face, so you see exactly who you're chatting with. Messages reach you no matter what you're doing - whether you're checking email, browsing the web, or listening to music.\"</p>
<p><strong>Notifications</strong> -- \"Cover feed is great for seeing everything going on in the world. But when something happens that's more important and directed at you, like a friend posting on your timeline, you'll receive notifications with their profile pictures.&nbsp;To open notifications, just tap them. And if you don't want to deal with them right now, you can just swipe to hide them and keep flipping through cover feed until you want them back.\"</p>
<p><strong>Apps</strong> -- Facebook will have its own apps drawer, similar to iOS and Android.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Apple's China Strategy Breaks New Ground</h2>
<p>In <a href=\"http://readwrite.com/2013/04/02/apple-apology-to-china-mission-accomplished\">Apple's apology to China</a> over allegedly shoddy customer support, Apple CEO Tim Cook said:</p>
<blockquote>We are aware that a lack of communications... led to the perception that Apple is arrogant and doesn't care or attach enough importance to consumer feedback. We express our sincere apologies for any concerns or misunderstandings this gave consumers.</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps Cook isn't aware, but nonchalance toward industry feedback and arrogance are hallmarks of Apple's history. Now it's apologizing for these traits? This from the company whose founder, Steve Jobs, famously said:</p>
<blockquote>Some people say, 'Give customers what they want.' But that's not my approach. Our job is to figure out what they're going to want before they do. I think Henry Ford once said, 'If I'd asked customers what they wanted, they would have told me, \"A faster horse!\"' People don't know what they want until you show it to them. That's why I never rely on market research. Our task is to read things that are not yet on the page.</blockquote>
<p>And from the same founder who, when told the iPhone 4 had serious antenna issues, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2010/06/24/apple-responds-over-iphone-4-reception-issues-youre-holding-th/\">told users</a> that they were holding the phone wrong?</p>
<h2>A Kinder, Gentler Apple</h2>
<p>This is a very different Apple. When you read Cook's apologies <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/letter-from-tim-cook-on-maps/\">on Apple Maps problems</a> or now on China, they actually read like <em>he's sorry</em>, and not simply going through the motions of looking apologetic.</p>
<p>It's a kinder, gentler Apple. And I'm not sure I like it.</p>
<p>Sure, there are good reasons for Apple to apologize. For one thing, it's the right thing to do when someone, or some company, messes up. For another, it's good business, and given Apple's recent stock market stumbles, making peace with Apple's biggest future market - worth $22.5 billion in fiscal 2012 and on a torrid growth pace - makes a lot of sense, as <em>All Things D</em>'s <a href=\"http://allthingsd.com/20130402/apple-had-to-apologize-to-china/\">John Paczkowski posits</a>.</p>
<h2>Missing Apple's Arrogance</h2>
<p>But I liked the Apple that was infuriating in its smug assurance that it was right. Because most of the time, it was, and holding its ground forced the industry to be more circumspect about easy assumptions about what would work. I know that I, personally, have been proved wrong many times about Apple, and am grateful that it <a href=\"http://www.appolicious.com/articles/2362-steve-jobs-apologizes-to-apple-customers-while-taking-shots-at-the-media\">hasn't listened to what I or others in the media were saying</a>.</p>

They can describe their desires only in terms of what they are already using….The richest vein for tech startups is creating the product that you want to use—that’s what Steve and Woz did.</blockquote>

It would soon take on a life of its own. Developers saw the value that Twitter could bring and started developing apps, clients and revenue models. Twitter, without really meaning to, had become a platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That platform, as Twitter generally saw it, was a threat to Twitter itself. In the past several years, Twitter has <a href=\"http://readwrite.com/2011/03/24/burned-by-twitters-api\" target=\"_blank\">restricted access to its APIs</a>, cut off some developer shops entirely and <a href=\"http://readwrite.com/2011/03/11/twitter_tells_developers_to_stop_building_twitter\" target=\"_blank\">consolidated control of the platform</a> to its own headquarters. <a href=\"http://readwrite.com/2012/08/16/developers-are-pissed-frustrated-by-new-twitter-decree\" target=\"_blank\">The developer community was outraged.</a></p>
<p>Twitter may have had a method to its madness. Yesterday, Twitter gave birth to “<a href=\"http://blog.twitter.com/2013/04/new-mobile-updates-for-android-iphone.html\" target=\"_blank\">Cards</a>” – a way for developers and media to connect their apps, media, products, photos, videos and galleries to Tweets. Cards is kind of a reverse method for Twitter to re-open its platform to developers and media. Consider it Twitter’s way of giving back to the developers it once spurned.</p>
<h2>What Are Twitter Cards?</h2>
<p>Twitter is getting meta. Metadata, that is.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href=\"https://dev.twitter.com/blog/mobile-app-deep-linking-and-new-cards\" target=\"_blank\">Essentially, Cards is all about metadata.</a> If you are unfamiliar with the term, metadata is data that describes other kinds of data. For instance, where did a Tweet come from (an app, publication, button)? What location did it come from and what time of day? What kind of media is attached to it? Twitter has long kept track of this data and allowed developers to use some of it. Most users on Twitter have little idea that one Tweet can generate more than a dozen different data points.</p>
<p>Twitter is now taking some of that data and making it forward facing to the public. Developers can access this data by choosing the type of Card they want (there are six kinds), inserting the proper meta tags and validating the content through Twitter. By doing that, Cards will be able to connect straight from Twitter to a variety of media, including apps. Or products. Twitter calls this process of “deep linking.”</p>
<p>What does that mean though? “Twitter now directly links to my app?” Really, it means exactly what it says.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class=\"embedded-Media-image img-caption-c\">
<img src=\"http://readwrite.com/files/twitter_card_path.jpg\" style=\"\" />
<span class=\"embedded-Media-image-caption\">Twitter card as seen on Twitter.com</span>
</span>
</p>
<p>Let’s take the example of mobile social network Path. I, the user, post a picture to Path and tweet it from the Path app for Android or iOS. You, my follower, see that photo and open the tweet from on the Web, mobile Web, iOS or Android.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since Path has set up Cards, on the bottom of you the tweet you will see “Get the Path app.” Click on that and Twitter will send you straight to Path on your device. If you don’t have Path installed, you will be directed to sign up for the service.</p>
<p><span class=\"embedded-Media-image img-caption-c\">
<img src=\"http://readwrite.com/files/path_from_twitter.jpg\" style=\"\" />
<span class=\"embedded-Media-image-caption\">Click the link, you are sent to Path on the Web. Same would work for Path mobile app.</span>
</span>
</p>
<p>For web sites, it is similar. Say I post one of my articles to Twitter (which I do, often). The Card will give a preview of my article and on the bottom it will say “View on ReadWrite.” That button will take you to the ReadWrite web site on whatever device you are using. We do not have a dedicated app for Android or iOS anymore, but if we did we could direct you there, too.</p>
<p>There are six kinds of Cards that you can now create. Per Twitter’s own description:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\"><strong>Summary Card:</strong> Default card, including a title, description, thumbnail and Twitter account attribution</span></li>
<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\"><strong>Photo Card</strong>: A Tweet sized photo card</span></li>
<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\"><strong>Gallery Card:</strong> A Tweet card geared toward highlighting a collection of photos</span></li>
<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\"><strong>App Card:</strong> A Tweet card for providing a profile of an application</span></li>
<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\"><strong>Player Card:</strong> A Tweet sized video/audio/media player card</span></li>

<h2>What Is New?</h2>
<p>The concept of Cards is not actually new at Twitter. Showing the preview of photos, articles and web sites from a link has been available since the middle of 2012. What is new are the expansion of the types of cards as well as the update to the Android, iOS and mobile web apps.</p>
<p>This is where it gets interesting.</p>
<p>Twitter has created the capability to send users all over the Internet. We are not just talking about links anymore. We are talking native apps, mobile web sites, or various types of media that can either stand alone or live within those apps. Twitter has basically just created a platform that can act as a directional compass for the Internet. One word for that is “platform.”</p>
<p>Platform is a very developer-centric term. When it comes to the Web and mobile apps, it more or less means “something that can be built on top of.” For Twitter, Cards has another type of connotation for its users:</p>
<p>Portal.</p>
<h2>Portal 2.0</h2>
<p>Portal has become something of a nasty word on the Web over the past several years. When we think portal, we think of the old AOL homepage or Yahoo or even iGoogle (which Google will kill on Nov. 1, 2013). Twitter Cards are like Portal 2.0, in a similar manner that Facebook has become. Portal 2.0 is inherently social and does not just send you to other Web content the way the original portals did. Portal 2.0 can send you a variety of types of media, like the app or the product page.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For instance, an enterprising company could use Cards to link to a product, like a pair of sunglasses. You could then purchase those new sunglasses from the site. Twitter could even be the arbiter of the transaction by using your account as authentication, tied to a credit card or other payment service.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, Cards as an example of Portal 2.0 are social, mobile, directional, built as a platform and, perhaps, transactional.</p><div class=\"feedflare\">

It would soon take on a life of its own. Developers saw the value that Twitter could bring and started developing apps, clients and revenue models. Twitter, without really meaning to, had become a platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That platform, as Twitter generally saw it, was a threat to Twitter itself. In the past several years, Twitter has <a href=\"http://readwrite.com/2011/03/24/burned-by-twitters-api\" target=\"_blank\">restricted access to its APIs</a>, cut off some developer shops entirely and <a href=\"http://readwrite.com/2011/03/11/twitter_tells_developers_to_stop_building_twitter\" target=\"_blank\">consolidated control of the platform</a> to its own headquarters. <a href=\"http://readwrite.com/2012/08/16/developers-are-pissed-frustrated-by-new-twitter-decree\" target=\"_blank\">The developer community was outraged.</a></p>
<p>Twitter may have had a method to its madness. Yesterday, Twitter gave birth to “<a href=\"http://blog.twitter.com/2013/04/new-mobile-updates-for-android-iphone.html\" target=\"_blank\">Cards</a>” – a way for developers and media to connect their apps, media, products, photos, videos and galleries to Tweets. Cards is kind of a reverse method for Twitter to re-open its platform to developers and media. Consider it Twitter’s way of giving back to the developers it once spurned.</p>
<h2>What Are Twitter Cards?</h2>
<p>Twitter is getting meta. Metadata, that is.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href=\"https://dev.twitter.com/blog/mobile-app-deep-linking-and-new-cards\" target=\"_blank\">Essentially, Cards is all about metadata.</a> If you are unfamiliar with the term, metadata is data that describes other kinds of data. For instance, where did a Tweet come from (an app, publication, button)? What location did it come from and what time of day? What kind of media is attached to it? Twitter has long kept track of this data and allowed developers to use some of it. Most users on Twitter have little idea that one Tweet can generate more than a dozen different data points.</p>
<p>Twitter is now taking some of that data and making it forward facing to the public. Developers can access this data by choosing the type of Card they want (there are six kinds), inserting the proper meta tags and validating the content through Twitter. By doing that, Cards will be able to connect straight from Twitter to a variety of media, including apps. Or products. Twitter calls this process of “deep linking.”</p>
<p>What does that mean though? “Twitter now directly links to my app?” Really, it means exactly what it says.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class=\"embedded-Media-image img-caption-c\">
				<img src=\"http://readwrite.com/files/twitter_card_path.jpg\" style=\"\" />
				<span class=\"embedded-Media-image-caption\">Twitter card as seen on Twitter.com</span>
		</span>
</p>
<p>Let’s take the example of mobile social network Path. I, the user, post a picture to Path and tweet it from the Path app for Android or iOS. You, my follower, see that photo and open the tweet from on the Web, mobile Web, iOS or Android.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since Path has set up Cards, on the bottom of you the tweet you will see “Get the Path app.” Click on that and Twitter will send you straight to Path on your device. If you don’t have Path installed, you will be directed to sign up for the service.</p>
<p><span class=\"embedded-Media-image img-caption-c\">
				<img src=\"http://readwrite.com/files/path_from_twitter.jpg\" style=\"\" />
				<span class=\"embedded-Media-image-caption\">Click the link, you are sent to Path on the Web. Same would work for Path mobile app.</span>
		</span>
</p>
<p>For web sites, it is similar. Say I post one of my articles to Twitter (which I do, often). The Card will give a preview of my article and on the bottom it will say “View on ReadWrite.” That button will take you to the ReadWrite web site on whatever device you are using. We do not have a dedicated app for Android or iOS anymore, but if we did we could direct you there, too.</p>
<p>There are six kinds of Cards that you can now create. Per Twitter’s own description:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\"><strong>Summary Card:</strong> Default card, including a title, description, thumbnail and Twitter account attribution</span></li>
<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\"><strong>Photo Card</strong>: A Tweet sized photo card</span></li>
<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\"><strong>Gallery Card:</strong> A Tweet card geared toward highlighting a collection of photos</span></li>
<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\"><strong>App Card:</strong> A Tweet card for providing a profile of an application</span></li>
<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\"><strong>Player Card:</strong> A Tweet sized video/audio/media player card</span></li>
<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\"><strong>Product Card:</strong> A Tweet card to better represent product content</span></li>
</ul>

"<p>Once upon a time, air travel was just about the only time I could escape the Internet. Now with in-flight Wi-Fi becoming more pervasive, even air travel has become a time to check Twitter, respond to emails and keep up with Arsenal's latest loss. I nearly always fly Delta, which has Wi-Fi on virtually every flight. But for those who fly other airlines, here's a quick review of which airlines lead and which lag in providing in-flight Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>As of September 2012, only <a href=\"http://www.thebeat.travel/post/2012/09/20/Delta-Leader-Inflight-Wi-Fi.aspx\">31% of US domestic flights</a> came equipped with in-flight Wi-Fi, nearly always through GoGo Internet, though there are <a href=\"http://www.informationweek.com/byte/personal-tech/wireless/byte-guide-to-in-flight-wi-fi/240144399\">other options</a>. Then, as now, Delta led the pack, but now everyone, including Delta, has expanded coverage. While only 5 to 10% of travelers actually use in-flight Wi-Fi, for those who do, it can be essential. (And peace destroying, but that's hardly the airlines' fault.)</p>
<p>Here's how things stack up:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Air Canada</strong>: A few 319s have GoGo service, but only for travel over the US</li>
<li><strong>AirTran</strong>: All planes have GoGo Wi-Fi</li>
<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.aa.com/i18n/urls/entertainmentOnDemand.jsp?anchorLocation=DirectURL&amp;title=wifi#wi-fi\">American</a></strong>: GoGo available on all 767-200 and 737 aircraft and most MD80 and 757 aircraft</li>
<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.alaskaair.com/content/travel-info/on-board/inflight-wifi.aspx\">Alaska</a></strong>: GoGo on virtually all flights over the lower 48 states, except for a few of the oldest 737-400s</li>

(description nil "<p>Once upon a time, air travel was just about the only time I could escape the Internet. Now with in-flight Wi-Fi becoming more pervasive, even air travel has become a time to check Twitter, respond to emails and keep up with Arsenal's latest loss. I nearly always fly Delta, which has Wi-Fi on virtually every flight. But for those who fly other airlines, here's a quick review of which airlines lead and which lag in providing in-flight Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>As of September 2012, only <a href=\"http://www.thebeat.travel/post/2012/09/20/Delta-Leader-Inflight-Wi-Fi.aspx\">31% of US domestic flights</a> came equipped with in-flight Wi-Fi, nearly always through GoGo Internet, though there are <a href=\"http://www.informationweek.com/byte/personal-tech/wireless/byte-guide-to-in-flight-wi-fi/240144399\">other options</a>. Then, as now, Delta led the pack, but now everyone, including Delta, has expanded coverage. While only 5 to 10% of travelers actually use in-flight Wi-Fi, for those who do, it can be essential. (And peace destroying, but that's hardly the airlines' fault.)</p>
<p>Here's how things stack up:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Air Canada</strong>: A few 319s have GoGo service, but only for travel over the US</li>
<li><strong>AirTran</strong>: All planes have GoGo Wi-Fi</li>
<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.aa.com/i18n/urls/entertainmentOnDemand.jsp?anchorLocation=DirectURL&amp;title=wifi#wi-fi\">American</a></strong>: GoGo available on all 767-200 and 737 aircraft and most MD80 and 757 aircraft</li>

<h2>First, The Rules</h2>
<p>There are potentially lots of ways someone could prevent themselves from being recorded, but in the interests of public safety and dignity, let's establish some ground rules right up front.</p>
<p><strong>Rule #1. Break No Laws:&nbsp;</strong>Clearly, one effective method of blocking Google Glass would be to just walk up and slap the things off someone's face and step on the devices when they fall to the ground.</p>
<p>I think we can all agree: <em>that's not a good solution</em>.</p>
<p>As tempting as it might be, causing personal injury and property damage is wrong and, frankly, stupid. So for the purposes of this exploration, any technique that breaks existing laws or causes lasting harm will be immediately disqualified.</p>
<p><strong>Rule #2. Don't Look Like A Dork:&nbsp;</strong>Wearing a knight's helm or a cardboard box on your head would certainly prevent the recording of your face while walking down the street, but it might also look a bit strange.</p>
<p>Let's assume that any acceptable blocking technique will not involve wearing something that falls way outside the norm for a given culture.</p>
<p><span class=\"embedded-Media-image img-caption-c\">
<img src=\"http://readwrite.com/files/google-glass-sunglasses.jpg\" style=\"\" />
</span>
</p>
<h2>Solutions Already Presented</h2>
<p>In some circles on the Internet, there have already been some suggestions about how to block these devices, all primarily based around actively jamming Google Glass. But, alas, there are problems with the existing technology behind every one of these solutions.</p>
<p><strong>Blinded By The Light:&nbsp;</strong>One rather drastic jamming method involves actively aiming a laser at the camera lens of a Glass device to effectively blind it.&nbsp;This would probably work, but involves some serious risks - that camera lens will be very close to someone's eye. A miss, therefore, could cause serious injury. Plus, given that both the laser and the Google Glass wearer could be moving, the odds of actually hitting the Google Glass camera lens would be very low, even for an automated targeting system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So lasers are out.&nbsp;(See Rule #1.)</p>
<p>Visible light shone in the general direction of a Google Glass wearer might be less dangerous, but in order to work - especially in broad daylight - they'd have to be bright enough to dazzle or distract the Glass wearers... and anyone standing (or driving) nearby. Focusing the beams to minimize light leakage could lead to the same issues faced by laser blinding.</p>
<p><strong>Infrared Jamming:&nbsp;</strong>For quite some time now, people have been kicking around the idea of using infrared LED lights to block security cameras from seeing someone's face. It might seem logical to apply that idea to jamming Google Glass, since infrared (IR) light is invisible to the human eye.</p>
<p>But such IR jammers, when they work at all - and there's some evidence they don't - would be effective only for cameras that use IR to monitor scenes in low-light situations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As far as we know, though, Google Glass' camera won't use IR sensors. So an array of IR LED lights worn on a hat or in a hood would be completely invisible to a Glass camera. And even if Glass <em>does</em> use IR sensing, there's no way any IR LED light could outshine ambient sunlight in daytime situations. Not without a huge power supply and creating enough heat to melt your face off. (See Rule #2.)</p>
<p><strong>Radio Frequency Jamming:&nbsp;</strong>The Internet is full of sites selling these bad boys: frequency jammers that can work on cell, WiFi and even Bluetooth frequencies.&nbsp;This would probably cover all the signals that Glass would use, and render these devices offline in your immediate vicinity. Of course, they would also disable any Internet-connected or cellular devices in range. That kind of overkill might or might not bother you, but it definitely bothers the FCC. In the U.S., at least, there's a much bigger problem: any active jamming of public radio frequencies is against the law. (See Rule #1.)</p>
<h2>Things That Might Actually Work</h2>
<p>Is there, then, no hope? Will we have to just endure the onslaught of Glass-like devices? Perhaps not. There are a few things that might provide a measure of privacy.</p>
<p><strong>Get Me Wardrobe:&nbsp;</strong>While tin-foil hats and the like would bust the \"dork\" rule, there should be some fashion choices that would help hide your identity.&nbsp;Big sunglasses, head scarves, large-brimmed hats… all kinds of accessories could mask your face in the presence of a Glass device. It's far from 100% protection, of course, but it's better than nothing.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span class=\"embedded-Media-image img-caption-r\">
<img src=\"http://readwrite.com/files/google-glass-ban.png\" style=\"\" />
</span>
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Glass-Free Zones:&nbsp;</strong>You may not have to worry about Glass use everywhere you go. Many locations are already leery of camera use, and are likely to enact rules again wearing Google Glass or similar devices.&nbsp;Just try to take a picture in a grocery store or a bank, for instance, and you will be firmly told to stop. Movie theaters, department stores, hospitals… there are many places where privacy and security concerns mean no photography is allowed.</p>
<p>It is unlikely that such restrictions will relax for Glass. In fact, we are seeing early evidence that some businesses are already imposing Glass-specific restrictions - including <a href=\"http://venturebeat.com/2013/03/09/seattle-bar-bans-google-glass-to-prevent-invasion-of-privacy-and-ugly-eyewear/\" target=\"_blank\">this Seattle bar</a>. Groups are forming to <a href=\"http://stopthecyborgs.org/google-glass-ban-signs/\" target=\"_blank\">encourage creation of Glass-free havens</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Opt-Out Signals:&nbsp;</strong>Finally, here's an idea that might solve the problem once and for all.&nbsp;Building on the LED-light idea, what if there was a tiny light on your person displaying a certain color that, when detected by Glass, would immediately blur your appearance on any recording? Or a special signal broadcast on Bluetooth from your phone that would do the same thing?</p>
<p>Obviously, this would require cooperation from Google's engineers to make sure the devices recognize and act upon the agreed-upon signals. And such a scheme probably could - and would - be hacked. But supporting an opt-out approach might be the easiest, best way to accomodate the rise of these devices without compromising the privacy of everyone in sight.</p>
<p>These are just a few ideas that could help prevent detection/recording by Google Glass. There have got to be more and better ways, so please share your ideas in the comments below.</p>

Plus, given that both the laser and the Google Glass wearer could be moving, the odds of actually hitting the Google Glass camera lens would be very low, even for an automated targeting system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So lasers are out.&nbsp;(See Rule #1.)</p>
<p>Visible light shone in the general direction of a Google Glass wearer might be less dangerous, but in order to work - especially in broad daylight - they'd have to be bright enough to dazzle or distract the Glass wearers... and anyone standing (or driving) nearby. Focusing the beams to minimize light leakage could lead to the same issues faced by laser blinding.</p>
<p><strong>Infrared Jamming:&nbsp;</strong>For quite some time now, people have been kicking around the idea of using infrared LED lights to block security cameras from seeing someone's face. It might seem logical to apply that idea to jamming Google Glass, since infrared (IR) light is invisible to the human eye.</p>
<p>But such IR jammers, when they work at all - and there's some evidence they don't - would be effective only for cameras that use IR to monitor scenes in low-light situations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As far as we know, though, Google Glass' camera won't use IR sensors. So an array of IR LED lights worn on a hat or in a hood would be completely invisible to a Glass camera. And even if Glass <em>does</em> use IR sensing, there's no way any IR LED light could outshine ambient sunlight in daytime situations. Not without a huge power supply and creating enough heat to melt your face off. (See Rule #2.)</p>
<p><strong>Radio Frequency Jamming:&nbsp;</strong>The Internet is full of sites selling these bad boys: frequency jammers that can work on cell, WiFi and even Bluetooth frequencies.&nbsp;This would probably cover all the signals that Glass would use, and render these devices offline in your immediate vicinity. Of course, they would also disable any Internet-connected or cellular devices in range. That kind of overkill might or might not bother you, but it definitely bothers the FCC. In the U.S., at least, there's a much bigger problem: any active jamming of public radio frequencies is against the law. (See Rule #1.)</p>
<h2>Things That Might Actually Work</h2>
<p>Is there, then, no hope? Will we have to just endure the onslaught of Glass-like devices? Perhaps not. There are a few things that might provide a measure of privacy.</p>
<p><strong>Get Me Wardrobe:&nbsp;</strong>While tin-foil hats and the like would bust the \"dork\" rule, there should be some fashion choices that would help hide your identity.&nbsp;Big sunglasses, head scarves, large-brimmed hats… all kinds of accessories could mask your face in the presence of a Glass device. It's far from 100% protection, of course, but it's better than nothing.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Glass-Free Zones:&nbsp;</strong>You may not have to worry about Glass use everywhere you go. Many locations are already leery of camera use, and are likely to enact rules again wearing Google Glass or similar devices.&nbsp;Just try to take a picture in a grocery store or a bank, for instance, and you will be firmly told to stop. Movie theaters, department stores, hospitals… there are many places where privacy and security concerns mean no photography is allowed.</p>
<p>It is unlikely that such restrictions will relax for Glass. In fact, we are seeing early evidence that some businesses are already imposing Glass-specific restrictions - including <a href=\"http://venturebeat.com/2013/03/09/seattle-bar-bans-google-glass-to-prevent-invasion-of-privacy-and-ugly-eyewear/\" target=\"_blank\">this Seattle bar</a>. Groups are forming to <a href=\"http://stopthecyborgs.org/google-glass-ban-signs/\" target=\"_blank\">encourage creation of Glass-free havens</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Opt-Out Signals:&nbsp;</strong>Finally, here's an idea that might solve the problem once and for all.&nbsp;Building on the LED-light idea, what if there was a tiny light on your person displaying a certain color that, when detected by Glass, would immediately blur your appearance on any recording? Or a special signal broadcast on Bluetooth from your phone that would do the same thing?</p>
<p>Obviously, this would require cooperation from Google's engineers to make sure the devices recognize and act upon the agreed-upon signals. And such a scheme probably could - and would - be hacked. But supporting an opt-out approach might be the easiest, best way to accomodate the rise of these devices without compromising the privacy of everyone in sight.</p>
<p>These are just a few ideas that could help prevent detection/recording by Google Glass. There have got to be more and better ways, so please share your ideas in the comments below.</p>
