<p><a href=\"http://whimsicalifornia.com/timebar/\">Timebar</a> is a new timer app for the Mac. Now, there are a ton of timer apps out there, and they are all fine. That’s the problem, as it were, they are just fine. I mean, what can a timer app do that is all that different? </p>
<p>Well, when I first saw Timebar, it blew me away. Not just because it found a way to handle this relatively simple problem, differently, but because the moment you see how it does it, you realize this is how timer apps on the Mac should have worked all along.</p>
<p>Timebar turns your Mac’s menubar itself into a visual timer. It overlays a translucent bar that gradually reduces as the time passes. All you need to get a sense of how much time is left is to glance up at your menubar. It’s really quite ingenious.</p>

<p>I say we make this first of April, and every first of April to come, the day where we take a digital sabbatical (at the very least, an online one). We use this day to take a break. Perhaps get an honest day&#8217;s work in. Maybe brush off that old notebook and sharpen that pencil and write out the things you&#8217;re going to get done tomorrow. If you are at work, perhaps this is a good day to clean your office. If at home, take the kids out to a museum. Perhaps this is the day to put on your favorite road songs, get in the car, pick a direction, and drive for a few hours and see where you end up. Because that place, no matter where it is, will be better than just about anything else you will see online today. I think you get the idea.</p>
<p>Because, well, it is already pretty difficult to sift the meaning from the noise from the constant connection. It is even more so when you have to question almost everything you see on it for a day. Life is short. There are better things to do. Ignore it today.
