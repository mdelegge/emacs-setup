what’s downloaded the most. But let’s not mistake downloads for
popularity. These are apps that people may have downloaded, used
once, then deleted. What you really want is a list that shows what
apps that people <em>like you</em> are using and enjoying. That’s the kind
of information that companies like Amazon and Netflix are terrific
at leveraging.</p></blockquote><div><a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘&#8216;Topping the Charts and Racing to the Bottom&#8217;’\"  href=\"http://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/06/06/august-charts\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a></div>

<p>Matthew Panzarino, on Tim Cook&#8217;s &#8220;he didn&#8217;t really say much&#8221; appearance at D11:</p><blockquote><p>But these days they’re almost beholden to ask the ‘what’s next’
questions that everyone expects every year. If they don’t ask
them, everyone will complain about them not doing so, and yet
everyone complains when the same questions get the same
non-answers. It’s got to be a tough position to be in. But my
feeling on this, and I think that it’s shared by people both
inside and outside of Apple, is that it’s time to start asking him
better stuff.</p><p>The result of this can be seen in a series of videos from <a href=\"http://www.macrumors.com/2013/06/03/apple-ceo-tim-cook-speaks-on-leadership-at-duke-university/\">Cook’s
visit to the Duke Fuqua School of Business</a> that he filmed in April
but were released just this week. The clips are a must watch. Cook
talks about what he wants in employees, how to lead, how to
collaborate and touches on several other great topics. There’s
very little Apple specific stuff, though he mentions the company,
but there’s a bunch of really interesting philosophical and
tactical information that I’ve never heard him speak about
anywhere else.</p></blockquote><p>Asking Tim Cook (or any other Apple executive) questions you know he isn&#8217;t going to answer isn&#8217;t being a &#8220;tough&#8221; journalist. It&#8217;s just a waste of time and a rare opportunity. Sure, ask him up front if he&#8217;s willing to talk about upcoming Apple products, get his &#8220;no&#8221; on the record. But then move on to questions he might actually answer.</p><div><a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘How to Ask Tim Cook Questions’\"  href=\"http://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/06/05/cook-questions\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a></div>

<p>Julian Assange reviews Eric Schmidt and Jared Cohen&#8217;s new book, <em>The New Digital Age</em>, for the NYT:</p><blockquote><p>I have a very different perspective. The advance of information
technology epitomized by Google heralds the death of privacy for
most people and shifts the world toward authoritarianism. This is
the principal thesis in my book, <em>Cypherpunks</em>. But while Mr.
Schmidt and Mr. Cohen tell us that the death of privacy will aid
governments in “repressive autocracies” in “targeting their
citizens,” they also say governments in “open” democracies will
see it as “a gift” enabling them to “better respond to citizen and
customer concerns.” In reality, the erosion of individual privacy
in the West and the attendant centralization of power make abuses
inevitable, moving the “good” societies closer to the “bad” ones.</p></blockquote><div><a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘&#8216;The Banality of &#8220;Don’t Be Evil&#8221;&#8217;’\"  href=\"http://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/06/03/assange-schmidt\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a></div>

favored iOS devices when it comes to adding features to its

suggest iOS had been &#8220;unfairly favored.&#8221;</p><p>Instead of pro-Apple favouritism, the Trust found a series of
quite logical reasons why Android lagged iOS when new features
were added to iPlayer, mostly surrounding the &#8220;complexity and
expense&#8221; of developing for Android.</p><p>The company also noted a couple of other logical reasons why
developers dealing with limited time and budget would opt for
Apple&#8217;s mobile OS:</p><ul><li>Engagement is higher on Apple devices</li><li>Android is fragmented</li><li>Android development is complex and expensive</li></ul></blockquote><p>OK, but other than that, how did you enjoy developing for Android, Mrs. Lincoln?</p><div><a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘Android Fragmentation’\"  href=\"http://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/06/03/android-fragmentation\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a></div>

and it&#8217;s anything but typical. FlatWorld is partly owned by the
named inventor on the patents, a Philadelphia design professor
named Slavko Milekic. But 35 percent of the company has been
quietly controlled by an attorney at one of Apple&#8217;s own go-to law
firms, Morgan, Lewis &amp; Bockius. E-mail logs show that the
attorney, John McAleese, worked together with his wife and began
planning a wide-ranging patent attack against Apple&#8217;s touch-screen
products in January 2007 &#8212; just days after the iPhone was
revealed to the world.</p><p>Jennifer McAleese reached out to numerous &#8220;troll patent&#8221;
companies, as she called them, convinced that she and Milekic had
an &#8220;excellent position against Apple&#8221; if and when they chose to
sue. She e-mailed top patent lawyers at Google and Nokia,
competitors known to be in patent clashes with Apple.</p><p>The whole time she was advised by her husband, a lawyer who had
access to reams of confidential Apple data &#8212; but who says he
never touched it. (Apple doesn&#8217;t see it that way.) Together, the
McAleeses created &#8220;an indirect and covert pipeline&#8221; of information
pumped to FlatWorld&#8217;s attorneys according to Apple lawyers.</p></blockquote><p>One of the most bizarre patent troll stories I&#8217;ve ever seen.</p><div><a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘Apple Facing Touchscreen Patent Lawsuit, Filed by Attorney at Apple&#8217;s Own Law Firm’\"  href=\"http://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/06/03/apple-mcaleese-troll\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a></div>

<p>Frank Shaw, writing from the D11 conference:</p><blockquote><p>On one hand, looking around the conference, there were iPads and
other tablets as far as the eye could see. On the other hand, (as
I noted in a tweet), most of the people around me were using their
iPads exactly as they would a laptop &#8212; physical keyboard
attached, typing away, connected to a network of some kind,
creating a document or tweet or blog or article. In that context,
it’s hard to distinguish between a tablet and a notebook or
laptop. The form factors are different, but let’s be clear, each
is a PC.</p></blockquote><p>You could have won a lot of money making bar bets a decade ago that in 2013, Microsoft&#8217;s communications chief would make an argument that positions Apple as the number one maker of PCs by volume in the world.</p><p>It&#8217;s a good piece, and I agree with his conclusion:</p><blockquote><p>When you strip away all the post-PC rhetoric, maybe we’re all
saying the same thing &#8212; the future is about killer devices
connected to amazing cloud services. That’s the future Microsoft
is embracing, and that’s the future that everyone here at the D
Conference is excited about.</p></blockquote><div><a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘Counting Tablets as PCs’\"  href=\"http://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/05/31/shaw-ipad-pcs\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a></div>

<p>Rene Ritchie, on Microsoft&#8217;s new iPad vs. Windows 8 campaign:</p><blockquote><p>Instead of competing with that, trying to out do Apple at that,
Microsoft, like almost everyone else before them, has fallen into
the feature set trap. Here&#8217;s the problem with that &#8212; it doesn&#8217;t
matter what something can do, it only matters what you can do with
that something.</p><p>These ads will help Microsoft convince some people to buy a
Windows 8 tablet rather than an Android tablet or another kind of
Windows PC. It won&#8217;t convince the hundreds of millions of iPad
customers and iPad-inclined customers to do anything other than to
continue buying iPads.</p></blockquote><p>I&#8217;m curious what their goal is with this campaign. Do they think PowerPoint is the sort of thing that will take the air out of the iPad? Or are they going after a different market, shoring up the parts of their existing user base that really <em>does</em> need PowerPoint? If it&#8217;s the latter, I think this is an effective campaign.</p><p>It is a little rich, though, that they repeatedly use the absence of Microsoft apps on the iPad as knocks against the iPad. It&#8217;s Microsoft&#8217;s choice, not Apple&#8217;s, that there is no PowerPoint for iPad. Makes me wonder whether the Office team is being blocked from doing apps for iOS in order to protect Windows.</p><div><a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘The Feature Set Trap’\"  href=\"http://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/05/31/feature-set-trap\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a></div>

<p>Good piece from Jim Dalrymple on WWDC:</p><blockquote><p>The important thing to remember about WWDC is that it is a
developer conference. It’s not a place where Apple is going to
show off the newest iPhone or iPad. These are Apple’s flagship
products and they demand separate events.</p></blockquote><p>Pretty sure Jim&#8217;s right that there aren&#8217;t going to be new iPads or iPhones announced. But Apple did announce new iPhone hardware for a few years at WWDC: the 3G, 3GS, and 4. It&#8217;s just that the schedule for the iPhone changed. So I think it&#8217;s not so much that they wouldn&#8217;t announce a new iPhone or iPad during the WWDC keynote, but simply that they don&#8217;t yet have new iPhones or iPads to announce.</p><div><a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘WWDC Expectations’\"  href=\"http://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/05/29/wwdc-expectations\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a></div>

<p>Matt Yglesias:</p><blockquote><p>When you&#8217;re sitting on tens of billions of dollars, the sky is
really the limit. But Apple CEO Tim Cook has mainly used the cash
for dividends and share buybacks. That is a bit boring. And it&#8217;s
especially disappointing because when they&#8217;re not in defensive
mode, Apple fans are happy to acknowledge that not everything is
perfect. Launching an independent mapping service was a necessary
strategic move, for example, but Apple does not have the best
mapping data in the world. Developers feel that iCloud has lots of
problems. You can buy NBA League Pass Broadband to watch NBA games
on your Apple TV, but the package doesn&#8217;t include playoff games
because exclusive rights have been sold to TNT and ESPN. None of
these are crippling flaws in the Apple ecosystem, but they are
flaws. And as a customer, I&#8217;d rather see Apple address those flaws
than give money to shareholders. What&#8217;s more, <em>as a shareholder</em>
I&#8217;d rather see Apple address those flaws than give money to
shareholders. Profits are great, but they should be used to do
great things.</p></blockquote><p>This is a much more interesting argument.

<p><a href=\"http://www.technovia.co.uk/2013/05/apple-versus-after-john-gruber.html\">Ian Betteridge spoofed my &#8220;Google Versus&#8221; piece from yesterday</a>, using this oft-cited quote from Steve Jobs speaking at Macworld Expo back in 1997:</p><blockquote><p>“We have to let go of this notion that for Apple to win, Microsoft
has to lose,” Jobs said. “We have to embrace the notion that for
Apple to win, Apple has to do a really good job. If others are
going to help us, that’s great. Because we need all the help we
can get. […] The era of setting this up as a competition between
Apple and Microsoft is over.”</p></blockquote><p>Betteridge is off the mark on this one. That quote from Jobs was very specific. It came at a time when Apple was <em>not</em> making great products, and when Apple&#8217;s fans and perhaps even employees were locked into a mindset that the wrong platform &#8212; Windows &#8212; had won. That Windows&#8217;s almost unimaginable success, its spectacular rise to worldwide ubiquity, was an injustice &#8212; one that only Apple could right. He wasn&#8217;t claiming that for Apple to succeed <em>no one</em> had to lose, only Microsoft (and, really, Windows in particular &#8212; as opposed to then-future initiatives like MP3 players and mobile phones, where for Apple to succeed it certainly helped that Microsoft lost).</p><p>Note too that Jobs&#8217;s message was bitter medicine. He was surrendering a war that the audience wanted Apple to continue fighting. As Jason Breitkopf noted in a comment on Betteridge&#8217;s piece, Jobs was booed, resoundingly,<sup id=\"fnr1-2013-05-16\"><a href=\"#fn1-2013-05-16\">1</a></sup> by the Macworld audience several times during his announcement. Page&#8217;s message at I/O was greeted with applause. Page was telling the I/O audience what they wanted to hear, that Google is something other than a ruthless, greedy competitor.</p><p>I&#8217;m not arguing that Apple is not also a ruthless and greedy competitor. In fact, <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/2013/05/google_versus\">my piece yesterday</a> had nothing to do with Apple &#8212; only Google. (I should have left Android and the iPhone out of it, as that was the only oblique reference to Apple.) The difference is that Apple hasn&#8217;t claimed otherwise. Again, Jobs wasn&#8217;t claiming in 1997 that <em>no one</em> had to lose for Apple to win. The drum I&#8217;m trying to bang here is not that Google is a greedy competitor, but rather that Google is a greedy competitor that presents itself as anything but &#8212; as a sort of peaceful, whimsical, happy-go-lucky techno-futurist corporate utopian &#8212; and that rather than see this pose as absurd, many people, Googlers and Google users alike, buy it.</p><p>All organizations have aspirations. You&#8217;re welcome to roll your eyes at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZeOhnTuq2I\">Steve Jobs&#8217;s spiel about Apple existing at the intersection of technology and the liberal arts</a>, or <a href=\"http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-07/30/jonathan-ive-revenue-good-design\">this from Jony Ive</a>:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;We are really pleased with our revenues but our goal isn&#8217;t to
make money. It sounds a little flippant, but it&#8217;s the truth. Our
goal and what makes us excited is to make great products. If we
are successful people will like them and if we are operationally
competent, we will make money,&#8221; he said.</p></blockquote><p>Mere spin? Perhaps. But those statements from Jobs and Ive are not absurd. If they&#8217;re not the absolute truth, they&#8217;re at least truthy. Whereas Larry Page&#8217;s pablum regarding Google not being pitted against other companies is farcical. <a href=\"http://www.macdevcenter.com/lpt/a/2387\">Tim O&#8217;Reilly had a good line about Microsoft</a> a decade ago:</p><blockquote><p>Microsoft gets a lot of heat for not leaving enough on the table
for others. My mother, who&#8217;s English, and quite a character, once
said of Bill Gates, &#8220;He sounds like someone who would come to your
house for dinner and say, &#8216;Thank you. I think I&#8217;ll have all the
mashed potatoes.&#8217;&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>That&#8217;s Google today. What major tech giant has Google <em>not</em> pitted itself against? Whose mashed potatoes <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/business/2013/03/google-slips-accidentally-unveils-evernote-like-google-keep-service/\">do they not seek to take</a>? Apple, Microsoft, Yahoo, Oracle, Facebook, Twitter, Amazon &#8212; Google has made enemies of all of them. The difference between Google&#8217;s predatory rapaciousness today and Microsoft&#8217;s of yore is that Microsoft wore it on their sleeve, they owned it, celebrated it.</p><p>What rankles about Google is their hypocrisy.</p><div class=\"footnotes\"><hr /><ol><li id=\"fn1-2013-05-16\"><p>Seriously, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxOp5mBY9IY\">watch the video</a>.

or some stupid thing, and I just don’t find that very interesting.
We should be building great things that don’t exist. Being
negative isn’t how we make progress. Most important things are not
zero sum, there is a lot of opportunity out there.</p></blockquote><p>Google fans seem to eat this kumbaya stuff up, to really believe it. But Google is the company that built Android after the iPhone, Google Plus after Facebook, and now a subscription music service after Spotify. They entered the RSS reader market, wiped it out, and are now just walking away from it. Gmail? Webmail but better.

<p><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/05/12/droidfooding-home/\">Josh Constine, writing for AOL/TechCrunch</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Facebook didn’t realize just how important widgets, docks, and app
folders were to Android users, and that leaving them out of Home
was a huge mistake. That’s because some of the Facebookers who
built and tested Home normally carry iPhones, I’ve confirmed. Lack
of “droidfooding” has left Facebook scrambling to add these
features, whose absence have led Home to just 1 million downloads
since launching a month ago. […]</p><p>The lack of droidfooders didn’t have serious consequences until
Home, Facebook’s new “apperating system”. It replaces the lock
screen, homescreen, and app launcher of compatible Android phones
with a Facebook-centric experience. It offers Cover Feed, a big,
beautiful way to browser the news feed the second you bring your
phone out of sleep. It’s missing the ability to build real-time
information widgets, put your most used apps in a persistently
visible dock, or organize your collection of apps into folders.</p></blockquote><p>Constine is jumping to some unsupported conclusions here. Is it possible that Facebook Home has fallen flat on Android because it was designed by iPhone users? That&#8217;s certainly possible. But more likely, it seems to me, is that Facebook Home is just a bad idea. As I said <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/05/10/facebook-flop\">last week</a>, it&#8217;s a well-designed implementation of an idea no one wants. Would iPhone users want this? I can&#8217;t see why. And if the problem is that Facebook Home designers are iPhone users, it might explain why they didn&#8217;t see the appeal of widgets, but how would it explain the lack of a persistent app dock or app folders? The iPhone has those. I suspect most iPhone users would miss them if they were able to install Facebook Home.</p><p>Facebook Home isn&#8217;t an iPhone idea. It&#8217;s just a bad idea. <a href=\"http://stratechery.com/2013/facebook-phones-and-the-future-of-mobile-communication/\">Facebook is an app, not a platform.</a> A good home screen interface is one that accommodates any app or service, not just one.</p><p>There is a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food\">dogfooding</a> lesson here, though. Does Mark Zuckerberg carry an HTC First, or any other Android phone with Facebook Home installed? Does Mike Matas? (Doesn&#8217;t look like it, judging by the &#8220;via Twitter for iPhone&#8221; metadata on his <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mike_matas/status/324186555390513154\">recent</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/mike_matas/status/327681441796325376\">tweets</a>.) Why not?</p><p>It&#8217;s always a sign of trouble when you&#8217;ve built something you don&#8217;t want to use yourself. Why does everyone I know who works at Apple carry an iPhone? Every single one? Not because they have to. It&#8217;s because they <em>want</em> to.</p><p>Turn Facebook Home into an interface that Facebook designers and engineers <em>want</em> to use, not merely feel obligated to use, and then they&#8217;ll have something. But if it remains something that even Facebook&#8217;s own designers and engineers do not prefer over the iPhone (or stock Android, or any other platform), if it remains something that the company needs propaganda posters to promote even among its own employees, then Facebook Home will remain what it is now. A dud.</p>

<p>Michael Copeland, two weeks ago <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/business/2013/04/marc-andreessen-and-rockmelt-betting-on-desktop/\">writing for Wired</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Marc Andreessen has a thought exercise for you.</p><p>Let’s say we all grew up in tech world where we only used
tablets and smartphones. Then one day, someone comes up to you
with a 27-inch display hooked up to a notebook. You could have
everything you have on your tablets and smartphones, and then
some. Except you don’t have to download anything or update it.
Everything is the latest and greatest, and just one click away. If
you are a software developer, there are no gatekeepers telling you
if your latest creation is approved, or when you can add the
latest flourish.</p><p>“We would be like, wow, that’s great,” Andreessen says from
his office at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. “It’s
why in the long run the mobile web is going to dominate native
apps, and for the same reason that on the desktop the web
dominates apps. When the web works for something, it works way
better in a whole lot of ways than a downloadable app.”</p></blockquote><p>There&#8217;s some conflation here between two different debates. The first is desktop vs. mobile computing &#8212; Mac OS X and Windows vs. iOS and Android. Trucks vs. cars, to reuse <a href=\"http://allthingsd.com/20130109/steve-jobs-was-right-tablets-are-cars-pcs-are-trucks/\">Steve Jobs&#8217;s analogy</a>.</p><p>The other is native apps vs. web apps, where by web apps I mean apps that run in a web browser tab. These are separate debates for the obvious reason that you can choose between either type of app (native or web) on either type of computer (desktop or mobile).</p><p>The growth in desktop computers is over, and it&#8217;s never coming back. Some people, but only a few, who grow up driving cars are ever going to decide they actually need a truck. Tablets and smartphones are already consuming all of the growth in personal computing, and it&#8217;s only going to accelerate as the hardware and software begin to mature. iPads and iPhones are adolescent, at best.</p><p>Andreessen does have a solid point in the fact that app stores are in some ways a pain in the ass &#8212; particularly Apple&#8217;s App Store, with its deliberative and at times opaque approval process. But app stores are mostly only a pain in the ass for developers, not users. Installing and especially updating apps through app stores is obvious and easy for all of the modern mobile platforms. And even for developers, there are aspects that are superior. With paid apps, for example, the apps store model is a win. The user taps a &#8220;Buy&#8221; button and enters their password, and boom, they&#8217;ve bought the app. Web apps can&#8217;t do that. (Paid apps are not of much interest to venture capitalists such as Andreessen.)</p><p>There is a trust factor at play: having no gatekeeper is a good thing for developers in terms of convenience, but not necessarily for users in terms of security, privacy, and system stability. The same gatekeeper annoying developers with an approval process is the trusted source telling users, <em>This app is OK, no harm will come to you from installing it</em>.</p><p>iOS has proven that user experience matters, not merely among a picky few but in the mass market. The quality of the user experience isn&#8217;t always primary, but it can be, and when it is, native still wins every time.</p><p>Today, in 2013, even the best-crafted mobile web apps come nowhere near the quality of experience of the best native apps. In fact, with but a few exceptions, the best mobile web apps today still don&#8217;t approach the quality of the first batch of native iPhone apps from 2007.<sup id=\"fnr1-2013-04-30\"><a href=\"#fn1-2013-04-30\">1</a></sup></p><p>Facebook, bless them, has it right. What&#8217;s great about the web is ubiquitous network availability, not running within a browser tab. Websites are just services, and what you see in a browser tab is merely one possible interface to that service. The best possible interface to that service is often, if not usually, going to be a native app, not a web app.</p><p>Andreessen has been singing <a href=\"http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Marc_Andreessen\">this same song</a> since the &#8217;90s, when he was leading Netscape. But web apps today are no closer to obviating native apps on mobile devices than they are on the desktop, where we&#8217;ve been using and developing them since Bill Clinton was president of the United States.</p><p>There are no absolutes in either of these arguments. No one is arguing that desktop computers are obsolete or will be any time soon. Nor is anyone arguing that all apps should be native.</p><p>Web apps absolutely have their place. I use several, daily. I&#8217;ve even <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/dingus\">made</a> a few. But most of the ones I use, I do so because they have no native app counterpart, and I wish they did, so that I could use the native app instead.<sup id=\"fnr2-2013-04-30\"><a href=\"#fn2-2013-04-30\">2</a></sup></p><p>The dynamic remains unchanged. Web apps are the best way to reach the most possible people with the least effort; native apps are the best way to create the best possible experience.</p><div class=\"footnotes\"><hr /><ol><li id=\"fn1-2013-04-30\"><p>One such exception: the excellent weather app <a href=\"http://blog.forecast.io/its-not-a-web-app-its-an-app-you-install-from-the-web/\">Forecast</a>. &nbsp;<a href=\"#fnr1-2013-04-30\"  class=\"footnoteBackLink\"  title=\"Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.\">&#8617;</a></p></li><li id=\"fn2-2013-04-30\"><p>Not a day goes by that I don&#8217;t crave a native Mac client for <a href=\"http://glassboard.com/\">Glassboard</a>.&nbsp;<a href=\"#fnr2-2013-04-30\"  class=\"footnoteBackLink\"  title=\"Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.\">&#8617;</a></p></li></ol></div>

<p><a href=\"http://stratechery.com/2013/apple-rejects-google-now-eu-to-investigate/\">Ben Thompson imagines an alternate 2013 in which Android did not exist</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Google today announced via their blog that they are filing a
complaint with the Justice Department and EU regarding Apple’s
recent rejection of Google Now for iOS. […]</p><p>The iPhone, which was launched in 2007, is on 70% of the world’s
smartphones, and 35% of all phones worldwide. Microsoft is in a
distant second place, with less than 10% of the smartphone market.</p></blockquote><p>I&#8217;ve been greatly enjoying Thompson&#8217;s writing at <a href=\"http://stratechery.com/\">Stratechery</a>; it&#8217;s easily one of my favorite new sites of the year, and you could do worse than devote the next hour or two to reading the whole thing back to last month, when he began. Among several standouts, I recommend &#8220;<a href=\"http://stratechery.com/2013/two-bears/\">Two Bears</a>&#8221; (dissecting the two bear arguments against Apple&#8217;s future success, and how only one makes sense, but the other might in fact apply to Samsung) and &#8220;<a href=\"http://stratechery.com/2013/apple-the-black-swan/\">Apple the Black Swan</a>&#8221;.</p><p>But with today&#8217;s piece, we have a first: one where I disagree with Thompson&#8217;s conclusions.</p><p>First, I don&#8217;t think the iPhone&#8217;s market share or sales numbers would be all that different in a world without Android; other mobile OSes simply would have picked up the slack. Windows Phone, for one. WebOS/Palm for another. The key is that the carriers have never liked the iPhone because of the control Apple has over every aspect of it. (To this day, (almost) no other phone gets software updates directly from the phone maker.) They would have pushed something else instead of Android, and others would have filled the obvious need for an iPhone-like touchscreen mobile OS. It might have set them back an extra year, but knowing what we now know about Samsung&#8217;s strategy and culture, can there be any doubt that they&#8217;d be fielding a line-up of iPhone-esque smartphones today, with or without Android?</p><p>Would the iPhone have higher sales and larger market share in a world without Android? Almost certainly. I just don&#8217;t think <em>that</em> much higher than what we see today. The difference between the iPhone and iPod (which has maintained roughly 70 percent market share in the media player market) is not the existence of Android, but rather the necessity and influence of mobile carriers.</p><p>Second, even in the scenario Thompson outlines, in which the iPhone wields a majority market share in smartphones in a no-Android world, I would be quite surprised if Apple abused that position to do something like reject Google Now from the App Store. If anything, in a no-Android world (or in a world where Android existed but Google had <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2005-08-16/google-buys-android-for-its-mobile-arsenal\">never acquired it</a>), I would expect Apple and Google to have an alliance. Remember, in 2007, <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/09/29/maps-original-iphone\">Eric Schmidt was on Apple&#8217;s board</a>, and Steve Jobs invited him on stage during the iPhone introduction to sing a version of &#8220;Kumbaya&#8221; about how Apple made great devices, Google made great online services, and how amazingly well the two companies&#8217; strengths fit together into a cohesive whole for their shared customers.</p><p>Take three minutes and watch <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vtdamKEcH8\">this video of Jobs and Schmidt on stage</a>. Sure seems like a long time ago. Schmidt, we now know, wasn&#8217;t exactly being honest about how he saw things playing out &#8212; but I do think he was accurately describing how <em>Apple</em> saw things playing out. In a world where Android didn&#8217;t exist, I don&#8217;t think Apple would be forbidding Google from competing with Siri on the iPhone. Rather, I think Google would be providing much of the data for Siri.</p>

<p>Horace Dediu, &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.asymco.com/2013/04/16/escaping-pcs/\">Escaping PCs</a>&#8221;:</p><blockquote><p>If this estimate is considered then the operating profits from PC
operations imply that Apple generates more profit than all the top
5 PC vendors combined.</p><p>Assuming further that “other” vendors have the same profitability
ratio as the top 5 combined yields a figure of 45% “profit capture
of PC market” for Apple. This is not as good as its performance in
the phone market, where Apple has about 72%, but it’s not bad.</p></blockquote><p>And as with the phone handset industry, Apple&#8217;s profit share in PCs far outstrips its unit sale market share.</p><p>Matt Yglesias, after pondering Dediu&#8217;s numbers, <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2013/04/16/mac_profits_are_high_too_high.html\">suggests Apple should cut Mac prices to pursue market share</a>:</p><blockquote><p>One thing that pops out of this is that even though it&#8217;s the
iPhone and the iPad that make Apple such a giant company, they&#8217;re
pretty much killing it as a PC vendor too. That said, particularly
in light of the PC sector&#8217;s decline in the face of quality
improvements and a slowed consumer upgrade cycle, you have to
wonder why Apple&#8217;s corporate strategy involves such high profit
margins on Macs. It&#8217;s clear that profits from iPhone and iPad are
more than sufficient to meet Tim Cook&#8217;s goals in terms of
dividends and investments. According to Dediu, Apple earns an
average 19 percent operating margin on its Mac sales compared to 4
percent for Dell and less than that for HP, Lenovo, and Acer. A
question to ask is whether piling up extra cash in the Braeburn
Capital account is a smarter strategic move for Apple than
investing in larger market share via lower prices. You could cut
Mac prices 15 percent across the board to match Dell&#8217;s margins.</p><p>If it were me, though, I&#8217;d take a good hard look at really shaking
the industry up with a 20 percent price cut. That would reposition
the Mac as a loss-leader whose function is to enhance the overall
value of the Apple ecosystem.</p></blockquote><p>It&#8217;s not within Apple&#8217;s character to pursue market share for the sake of market share. I&#8217;m not even sure that price is what&#8217;s holding back further Mac market share gains. A lot of people buy Windows PCs specifically because Windows is what they&#8217;re familiar with; they don&#8217;t want to even consider a Mac for the same reason many of them are rejecting Windows 8: too different. </p><p>And, even if cutting Mac prices did significantly grow Mac market share, the customers Apple would gain from this strike me as unlikely to then generate profit for Apple by subsequently buying iPhones and iPads. By definition, the new customers they&#8217;d gain from slashing the price of Mac hardware would be price-sensitive customers. Why would those customers buy iPhones and iPads unless the prices of iPhones and iPads were also similarly slashed?</p><p>The &#8220;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_effect\">halo effect</a>&#8221; &#8212; the theory that Apple can get a new customer to buy one Apple product, that customer, if happy with their purchase, is likely to start buying other Apple products &#8212; strikes me as only likely to be effective if all those products are consistently priced and marketed. Industry observers break out PCs, tablets, smartphones, and media players into discrete product categories, but Apple, from a consumer branding perspective, does not. Macs, iPads, iPhones, and iPods are all just Apple products, and they&#8217;re all priced and designed the same way: seldom the cheapest, but usually the best.</p><p>It&#8217;s their consistency in that regard across all products that drives the halo effect, turning someone who never bought an Apple product in their life into someone with an iPhone, iPad, and MacBook.</p><p>The conventional wisdom is to pursue profits by maximizing market share. Apple pursues profits by specifically targeting only the high-margin segments of the overall market, and effectively forgoing market share in the low-margin segments, no matter how large those low-margin segments are.</p>

I can&#8217;t see why. And if the problem is that Facebook Home designers are iPhone users, it might explain why they didn&#8217;t see the appeal of widgets, but how would it explain the lack of a persistent app dock or app folders? The iPhone has those. I suspect most iPhone users would miss them if they were able to install Facebook Home.</p><p>Facebook Home isn&#8217;t an iPhone idea. It&#8217;s just a bad idea. <a href=\"http://stratechery.com/2013/facebook-phones-and-the-future-of-mobile-communication/\">Facebook is an app, not a platform.</a> A good home screen interface is one that accommodates any app or service, not just one.</p><p>There is a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food\">dogfooding</a> lesson here, though. Does Mark Zuckerberg carry an HTC First, or any other Android phone with Facebook Home installed? Does Mike Matas? (Doesn&#8217;t look like it, judging by the &#8220;via Twitter for iPhone&#8221; metadata on his <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mike_matas/status/324186555390513154\">recent</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/mike_matas/status/327681441796325376\">tweets</a>.) Why not?</p><p>It&#8217;s always a sign of trouble when you&#8217;ve built something you don&#8217;t want to use yourself. Why does everyone I know who works at Apple carry an iPhone? Every single one? Not because they have to. It&#8217;s because they <em>want</em> to.</p><p>Turn Facebook Home into an interface that Facebook designers and engineers <em>want</em> to use, not merely feel obligated to use, and then they&#8217;ll have something. But if it remains something that even Facebook&#8217;s own designers and engineers do not prefer over the iPhone (or stock Android, or any other platform), if it remains something that the company needs propaganda posters to promote even among its own employees, then Facebook Home will remain what it is now. A dud.</p>

    ") (title nil "★ If Not for Android, Where Would the iPhone Be?"))) ("★ Pricing and Profit Consistency and the Halo Effect" "<p>Horace Dediu, “<a href=\"http://www.asymco.com/2013/04/16/escaping-pcs/\">Escaping PCs</a>”:</p><blockquote><p>If this estimate is considered then the operating profits from PC
operations imply that Apple generates more profit than all the top
5 PC vendors combined.</p><p>Assuming further that “other” vendors have the same profitability
ratio as the top 5 combined yields a figure of 45% “profit capture
of PC market” for Apple. This is not as good as its performance in
the phone market, where Apple has about 72%, but it’s not bad.</p></blockquote><p>And as with the phone handset industry, Apple’s profit share in PCs far outstrips its unit sale market share.</p><p>Matt Yglesias, after pondering Dediu’s numbers, <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2013/04/16/mac_profits_are_high_too_high.html\">suggests Apple should cut Mac prices to pursue market share</a>:</p><blockquote><p>One thing that pops out of this is that even though it’s the
iPhone and the iPad that make Apple such a giant company, they’re
pretty much killing it as a PC vendor too. That said, particularly
in light of the PC sector’s decline in the face of quality
improvements and a slowed consumer upgrade cycle, you have to
wonder why Apple’s corporate strategy involves such high profit
margins on Macs. It’s clear that profits from iPhone and iPad are
more than sufficient to meet Tim Cook’s goals in terms of
dividends and investments. According to Dediu, Apple earns an
average 19 percent operating margin on its Mac sales compared to 4
percent for Dell and less than that for HP, Lenovo, and Acer. A
question to ask is whether piling up extra cash in the Braeburn
Capital account is a smarter strategic move for Apple than
investing in larger market share via lower prices. You could cut
Mac prices 15 percent across the board to match Dell’s margins.</p><p>If it were me, though, I’d take a good hard look at really shaking
the industry up with a 20 percent price cut. That would reposition
the Mac as a loss-leader whose function is to enhance the overall
value of the Apple ecosystem.</p></blockquote><p>It’s not within Apple’s character to pursue market share for the sake of market share. I’m not even sure that price is what’s holding back further Mac market share gains. A lot of people buy Windows PCs specifically because Windows is what they’re familiar with; they don’t want to even consider a Mac for the same reason many of them are rejecting Windows 8: too different. </p><p>And, even if cutting Mac prices did significantly grow Mac market share, the customers Apple would gain from this strike me as unlikely to then generate profit for Apple by subsequently buying iPhones and iPads. By definition, the new customers they’d gain from slashing the price of Mac hardware would be price-sensitive customers. Why would those customers buy iPhones and iPads unless the prices of iPhones and iPads were also similarly slashed?</p><p>The “<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_effect\">halo effect</a>” — the theory that Apple can get a new customer to buy one Apple product, that customer, if happy with their purchase, is likely to start buying other Apple products — strikes me as only likely to be effective if all those products are consistently priced and marketed. Industry observers break out PCs, tablets, smartphones, and media players into discrete product categories, but Apple, from a consumer branding perspective, does not. Macs, iPads, iPhones, and iPods are all just Apple products, and they’re all priced and designed the same way: seldom the cheapest, but usually the best.</p><p>It’s their consistency in that regard across all products that drives the halo effect, turning someone who never bought an Apple product in their life into someone with an iPhone, iPad, and MacBook.</p><p>The conventional wisdom is to pursue profits by maximizing market share. Apple pursues profits by specifically targeting only the high-margin segments of the overall market, and effectively forgoing market share in the low-margin segments, no matter how large those low-margin segments are.</p>" "http://daringfireball.net/2013/04/pricing_and_profit_consistency_and_the_halo_effect" (20847 119) old 47 nil nil ((link ((rel .

<p>Horace Dediu, &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.asymco.com/2013/04/16/escaping-pcs/\">Escaping PCs</a>&#8221;:</p><blockquote><p>If this estimate is considered then the operating profits from PC
operations imply that Apple generates more profit than all the top
5 PC vendors combined.</p><p>Assuming further that “other” vendors have the same profitability
ratio as the top 5 combined yields a figure of 45% “profit capture
of PC market” for Apple. This is not as good as its performance in
the phone market, where Apple has about 72%, but it’s not bad.</p></blockquote><p>And as with the phone handset industry, Apple&#8217;s profit share in PCs far outstrips its unit sale market share.</p><p>Matt Yglesias, after pondering Dediu&#8217;s numbers, <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2013/04/16/mac_profits_are_high_too_high.html\">suggests Apple should cut Mac prices to pursue market share</a>:</p><blockquote><p>One thing that pops out of this is that even though it&#8217;s the
iPhone and the iPad that make Apple such a giant company, they&#8217;re
pretty much killing it as a PC vendor too. That said, particularly
in light of the PC sector&#8217;s decline in the face of quality
improvements and a slowed consumer upgrade cycle, you have to
wonder why Apple&#8217;s corporate strategy involves such high profit
margins on Macs. It&#8217;s clear that profits from iPhone and iPad are
more than sufficient to meet Tim Cook&#8217;s goals in terms of
dividends and investments. According to Dediu, Apple earns an
average 19 percent operating margin on its Mac sales compared to 4
percent for Dell and less than that for HP, Lenovo, and Acer. A
question to ask is whether piling up extra cash in the Braeburn
Capital account is a smarter strategic move for Apple than
investing in larger market share via lower prices. You could cut
Mac prices 15 percent across the board to match Dell&#8217;s margins.</p><p>If it were me, though, I&#8217;d take a good hard look at really shaking
the industry up with a 20 percent price cut. That would reposition
the Mac as a loss-leader whose function is to enhance the overall
value of the Apple ecosystem.</p></blockquote><p>It&#8217;s not within Apple&#8217;s character to pursue market share for the sake of market share. I&#8217;m not even sure that price is what&#8217;s holding back further Mac market share gains. A lot of people buy Windows PCs specifically because Windows is what they&#8217;re familiar with; they don&#8217;t want to even consider a Mac for the same reason many of them are rejecting Windows 8: too different. </p><p>And, even if cutting Mac prices did significantly grow Mac market share, the customers Apple would gain from this strike me as unlikely to then generate profit for Apple by subsequently buying iPhones and iPads. By definition, the new customers they&#8217;d gain from slashing the price of Mac hardware would be price-sensitive customers. Why would those customers buy iPhones and iPads unless the prices of iPhones and iPads were also similarly slashed?</p><p>The &#8220;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_effect\">halo effect</a>&#8221; &#8212; the theory that Apple can get a new customer to buy one Apple product, that customer, if happy with their purchase, is likely to start buying other Apple products &#8212; strikes me as only likely to be effective if all those products are consistently priced and marketed. Industry observers break out PCs, tablets, smartphones, and media players into discrete product categories, but Apple, from a consumer branding perspective, does not. Macs, iPads, iPhones, and iPods are all just Apple products, and they&#8217;re all priced and designed the same way: seldom the cheapest, but usually the best.</p><p>It&#8217;s their consistency in that regard across all products that drives the halo effect, turning someone who never bought an Apple product in their life into someone with an iPhone, iPad, and MacBook.</p><p>The conventional wisdom is to pursue profits by maximizing market share. Apple pursues profits by specifically targeting only the high-margin segments of the overall market, and effectively forgoing market share in the low-margin segments, no matter how large those low-margin segments are.</p>
