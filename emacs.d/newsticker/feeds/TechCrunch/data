But the general gist is that as far as the focus of its founders, Obvious as an entity is taking a backseat to the individual startups it has produced and funded.</p><p>Medium, the Obvious-incubated <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/15/ev-williams-takes-to-medium-to-discuss-the-true-purpose-of-his-new-publishing-tool/\">next-generation publishing platform</a>, is now operating as its own standalone company with Ev Williams spending &#8220;98 percent&#8221; of his time there. Some 30 staffers who previously were hired as Obvious employees are now working as full-time Medium employees.</p><p>Meanwhile, as we&#8217;ve reported previously, Stone is working on a <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/01/biz-stones-new-startup-jelly-sounds-like-a-home-for-do-gooders-on-the-go/\">new company called Jelly</a>. Goldman, for his part, is spending the bulk of his time helping to lead Branch from New York City and currently looking for an additional company to work with.</p><p>The more general collaborative relationship between Goldman, Stone, and Williams will continue to be called &#8220;Obvious,&#8221; the blog post says, but the entity as a corporation seems to be winding down, or at least scaling back. He explained how they will continue to work together and detailed Obvious&#8217; affiliations like this:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;&#8230;the collaboration between Biz, Jason, and myself — which we call &#8216;Obvious&#8217; — continues&#8230; Besides Medium, Branch, and Jelly, we have working relationships with Lift (of which I&#8217;m on the board), Beyond Meat and GoodFit (of which Biz is on the board) and Neighborland. We also have a handful of less-active partnerships with entrepreneurs we were lucky enough to angel invest in, like Findery, LaunchPad Toys, and Faraday Bikes. (There are a couple more, which we’ll announce when the time is right.)&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Via email today, Williams told TechCrunch that there are no hard feelings involved in the change &#8212; that it&#8217;s been a natural evolution over the past several months. In his blog post, he elaborated a bit on the reasons for the shift:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Turns out, we like focus. We rebooted Obvious in 2011 with a vague plan. We started investing, incubating, and experimenting to figure out what worked and what we wanted to do at this stage in our careers; we just knew we wanted to work together do stuff that mattered.</p><p>Among other things, the first few months taught us that we gravitated toward diving in more deeply on a small number of things — rather than having a lighter touch on many ventures.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>It&#8217;ll be exciting to see what the next chapter will bring for all involved here. </p><br /><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/793181/\"></a><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=c4vsQOuYBzY:or83oMw9w6Y:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=c4vsQOuYBzY:or83oMw9w6Y:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=c4vsQOuYBzY:or83oMw9w6Y:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=c4vsQOuYBzY:or83oMw9w6Y:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=c4vsQOuYBzY:or83oMw9w6Y:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=c4vsQOuYBzY:or83oMw9w6Y:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=c4vsQOuYBzY:or83oMw9w6Y:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=c4vsQOuYBzY:or83oMw9w6Y:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/c4vsQOuYBzY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/05/the-obvious-corp-takes-backseat-as-ev-williams-biz-stone-and-jason-goldman-shift-focus-to-individual-startups/feed/") (slash:comments nil "0") (media:thumbnail ((url .

Unlike many of the options for online discussion that exist today, Moot is designed to be very flexible and customizable, according to a site owner&#8217;s needs, while also being clean, simple, realtime, embeddable, and cross-platform. It even works on mobile devices like iOS and Android smartphones and tablets.</p><p>The company was founded by Portland-based serial entrepreneur <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/person/courtney-couch\">Courtney Couch</a>, along with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://jquerytools.org/\">jQuery Tools</a> creator <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/person/tero-piirainen\">Tero Piirainen</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/person/janne-lehtinen\">Janne Lehtinen</a>, both of Helsinki. The team had <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://flowplayer.org/about/\">previously worked</a> on popular web video player <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://flowplayer.org/\">Flowplayer</a>, which is what led them to the idea to create Moot in the first place.</p><p>Explains Couch, &#8220;we were rebuilding Flowplayer&#8217;s site and restructuring everything.  We had a separate support system and separate forums, and we wanted to have a completely static generated site. And there wasn&#8217;t really anything available,&#8221; he says. &#8220;We could install a separate forum software, but all our options looked like they were from the nineties&#8230;there wasn&#8217;t any sort of unified system that would combine the content, combine the users from commenting and forums, and allow us the configurability to create our own options.&#8221;</p><p>So they built one. And it&#8217;s called <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://moot.it/\">Moot</a>.</p><p>The platform allows the site owner to design the system to function however they want.</p><p>Maybe you only need commenting, or maybe you want commenting and forums, or maybe you want some comments to appear on the forums. Maybe you want flat commenting. Or threaded. And maybe you want users to be able to comment using the same username and password they&#8217;re already using on your service today.</p><p><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/05/goodbye-ugly-forums-moot-is-a-flexible-and-modern-platform-for-online-discussion-and-its-free/forums/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-793313\"></a></p><p>Moot allows for this kind of flexibility, but it adds a number of other useful features, too, while removing others which the founders feel are extraneous to core purpose of enabling online discussions. For example, posting inline photos and videos is not supported out of the box, but because Moot is configurable, a site owner could add these back in if it was mission-critical for them to do so.</p><p>Also not available are things like voting comments up or down, which Couch says can make following and replying to discussions confusing for users.</p><p>If Tumblr was the simpler form of blogging to the more powerful but complex WordPress, then Moot may be seen as the simpler commenting and discussion platform to the others on the market today. Just getting the basic forum up-and-running takes under a minute, notes Couch. Then it&#8217;s only a matter of copy-and-pasting some embed code.</p><p>While the most immediately noticeable thing about Moot is its clean and simple appearance, the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://moot.it/\">Moot homepage gives a detailed look</a> at the other features which make the platform interesting. For example, forums can now offer a realtime feed of posts, and users can track their own interactions in a &#8220;My Feed&#8221; section, which is also realtime.</p><p><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/05/goodbye-ugly-forums-moot-is-a-flexible-and-modern-platform-for-online-discussion-and-its-free/moot-feed/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-793325\"></a></p><p>Search is also fast and grammar-aware, correcting misspellings on the fly and finding related words (e.g. a searching for &#8220;configuring Pyton&#8221; would return posts with the phrase &#8220;configure Python&#8221;).</p><p><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/05/goodbye-ugly-forums-moot-is-a-flexible-and-modern-platform-for-online-discussion-and-its-free/forums-search/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-793312\"></a></p><p>The rest of the discussion on the topic searched will appear collapsed, but can be expanded from the search interface. The discussions update in realtime here, too, and you can reply directly from the search results page with just a click. (See above).</p><p>Site comments can be flat or threaded, but only one level deep, to keep threads easier to follow, says Couch. Comments can be liked by others, and Moot uses this metadata along with Akismet by WordPress and community voting to help it manage spam. Admins can manage and remove comments from an online dashboard, as expected, which is also designed with ease-of-use in mind.</p><p><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/05/goodbye-ugly-forums-moot-is-a-flexible-and-modern-platform-for-online-discussion-and-its-free/realtime-2/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-793327\"></a></p><p>Users can be identified as being online or offline, which is indicated with a red or green button next to their username. Users get to create their own usernames, but they can&#8217;t change them after the fact. They also can&#8217;t edit or delete their comments after a brief grace period following their post. After 2.71 minutes (aka &#8220;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(mathematical_constant)\">e</a>&#8220;), those comments become permanent unless an admin removes them.</p><p>&#8220;The reason for that is that if you ever come into a thread where people edited or deleted a post, you can&#8217;t follow it anymore,&#8221; says Couch. &#8220;It becomes incomprehensible.&#8221;</p><p>Moot&#8217;s core product, which competes to some extent with platforms like Discourse, Livefyre, Disqus, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.forummatrix.org/\">many</a> others, is free. Instead, the plan is to eventually charge for three advanced features: SSO (single sign-on) support ($20/month), custom branding ($5/month), and support for private forums ($10/month). These add-ons are not yet live, however.</p><p>In the meantime, interested site and forum owners can <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://moot.it/\">sign up to get started with the free platform here</a>.</p><br /><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/793289/\"></a><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=mOxIMFqNUik:wqs4pcsh-ME:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=mOxIMFqNUik:wqs4pcsh-ME:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=mOxIMFqNUik:wqs4pcsh-ME:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=mOxIMFqNUik:wqs4pcsh-ME:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=mOxIMFqNUik:wqs4pcsh-ME:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=mOxIMFqNUik:wqs4pcsh-ME:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=mOxIMFqNUik:wqs4pcsh-ME:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=mOxIMFqNUik:wqs4pcsh-ME:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/mOxIMFqNUik\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/05/goodbye-ugly-forums-moot-is-a-flexible-and-modern-platform-for-online-discussion-and-its-free/feed/") (slash:comments nil "0") (media:thumbnail ((url .

Enough attention, he said, to get Ziade and his team to explore making it into a standalone service with its own URL.</p><p>&#8220;Discovery is a still big deal,&#8221; he told TechCrunch. &#8220;We&#8217;re getting swamped with stuff to read.&#8221; And while his app has developed a dedicated audience using it to read content they are finding themselves, this will help them look at what others are reading, too.</p><p>The new, more visual version looks more like Flipboard than text river, with pictures and links through to either read later, share, or read instantly.</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A click through to read instantly takes you to the actual web page, with a link at the top to read in Readability&#8217;s stripped-down format:</p><p></p><p>And this is what that format then looks like:</p><p></p><p>Ziade says that Top Reads will also remain in Readability&#8217;s mobile app, which today accounts for just under half of all of the company&#8217;s traffic. Over time the two Top Reads will diverge in function: the in-app version will be a &#8220;best of&#8221; list, while the dedicated Top Reads site will display a much larger selection of content, with more features, like views of vertical subjects, coming soon.</p><p>Readability is currently funded by arc90, an app design studio based in New York, but the plan is to become a viable, standalone business. Ziade says Readability makes a modest revenue from licensing its &#8220;parsing engine&#8221; to a few device makers and other apps, which use it to present content on their own sites. Some of these are confidential; one that is Reeder, one of the companies aspiring to the soon-to-be-vacated Google Reader throne.</p><p>The idea will be to continue to build that out with more platform licensing deals, and to supplement that with big-data analytics based on discovering what kind of content is popular on the platform. Ziade says that just about every online publisher has had its content pass through Readability&#8217;s platform, so it becomes a huge repository of aggregated information about what is getting read. In that vein, getting more people reading and browsing through Top Reads will help further grow that dataset.</p><p>&#8220;We are already getting a really good sense of what people are reading on the web,&#8221; Ziade says. &#8220;Top Reads is the first step of surfacing that value.&#8221;</p><p>What&#8217;s interesting is that while services like Flipboard are &#8220;social&#8221; readers, with people using their social networks to share and discover content; Top Reads is a bit more old school, relying instead on a most-popular algorithm to select what goes on to its front page. The more something is read on Readability, the more likely it will appear on Top Reads. Crucially, the kind of data that Readability is putting together is not, for now at least, based on &#8220;learning&#8221; what you like or targeting you in any way.

They say reading is dying, that people mostly read tweets these days, people are actually reading tons, and we want to be in the middle of that.&#8221;</p><p></p><br /><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/793082/\"></a><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=L--5Zlf08p8:atO1Ey9KGxw:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=L--5Zlf08p8:atO1Ey9KGxw:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=L--5Zlf08p8:atO1Ey9KGxw:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=L--5Zlf08p8:atO1Ey9KGxw:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=L--5Zlf08p8:atO1Ey9KGxw:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=L--5Zlf08p8:atO1Ey9KGxw:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=L--5Zlf08p8:atO1Ey9KGxw:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=L--5Zlf08p8:atO1Ey9KGxw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/L--5Zlf08p8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/05/readability-launches-top-reads-an-online-magazine-aggregating-the-platforms-most-read-content/feed/") (slash:comments nil "0") (media:thumbnail ((url .

It was an exciting moment in history — one that my co-founders and I at Indiegogo didn&#8217;t expect to see for many years, especially not within just five years of launching our perks-based crowdfunding platform in 2008.</p><p>While the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rule-setting period has taken a bit longer than originally hoped and thus equity crowdfunding is taking longer to introduce than the Act anticipated, we&#8217;re quite pleased that the SEC is taking the process seriously.</p><h5><b>Regulations: A Hard Balance</b></h5><p>Striking a balance between the need for regulation and the danger of over-regulation is tricky. Too little regulation could lead to risky behavior — while too much regulation could stifle innovation and competition, and actually block the very economic activity equity crowdfunding is poised to create.</p><p>Crowdfunding rose into the mainstream long before the JOBS Act was passed. Since the launch of our perks-based approach to crowdfunding over five years ago – where entrepreneurs, artists and causes raise money in support of their dreams online by offering perks to funders &#8212; hundreds of other platforms have followed suit across the world.</p><p>When equity crowdfunding is introduced and allows funders actually to own a piece of the new businesses, pro-JOBS Act platforms like perk-based incumbents Indiegogo and Rockethub, or new equity-only players like Crowdfunder, will need to innovate by developing and testing new procedures that are safe, robust and customer-driven. As this is the first time equity crowdfunding will be possible in the Internet age, platforms need the opportunity to experiment, learn and build what customers actually need and want &#8212; rather than what regulators might think customers could want. Too much regulation could simply stifle the innovation required to make equity crowdfunding work.</p><p>Too much regulation could also reduce competition and lock out smaller equity crowdfunding platforms from launching, as burdensome regulation would make it expensive to get off the ground. Ironically, this would benefit well-resourced incumbents like us. But this is not what we would want.</p><h5><b>Indiegogo Perspective on the Risk of Over-Regulation</b></h5><p>For Indiegogo, we have a healthy and growing perks-based business and do not need equity crowdfunding to happen. That said we’d be disappointed if equity crowdfunding never has the chance to realize its innovation potential. The concept of equity crowdfunding is 100 percent in-line with our mission to make finance efficient and fair &#8212; removing gatekeepers from interfering with making dreams come true. We’ve innovated and developed an algorithm-driven platform in order to deliver a gatekeeper-free experience on our trusted perks platform. It would be disappointing &#8212; for example &#8211; if regulation somehow required us to put the gatekeeper back into the process, thus stifling our innovation and ability to make finance efficient and fair.</p><p>We’d also be disappointed if the regulation killed our competition, leaving us the sole player. As an equal opportunity platform, we’d defy our entire reason for being by hoping for a competition-free world.</p><p>Indiegogo pioneered crowdfunding as a way for people to fund what matters to them &#8212; whatever that might be. We don’t curate. We don&#8217;t judge. There are no gatekeepers on Indiegogo. We believe every idea (as long as it’s legal) deserves the right to connect with its audience and see if its audience is willing to fund it.</p><p>As a result of our inclusive approach, unique ideas &#8212; creative, cause and entrepreneurial &#8212; are coming to life through crowdfunding on Indiegogo as I write. They include the <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/activyst-bold-athletic-bags-that-help-girls-play-sports?website_name=activyst\">Breathomete</a>r</span> that turns a smartphone into a breathalyzer, the athletic bag company<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/activyst-bold-athletic-bags-that-help-girls-play-sports?website_name=activyst\"> Activyst</a> that supports girls sports programs across the world, and the band <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/avasa-matty-love-new-album\"> Avasa &amp; Matty</a>, a husband-wife duo working on their next album. Even the world’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/help-the-haleys-have-a-baby?website_name=babyhaley\">first baby</a> was crowdfunded last year. (The campaign helped a family pay for in-vitro fertilization). These ideas are not alone. Every week, Indiegogo distributes millions of dollars in four currencies to campaigns in every country.</p><p>Given we aren’t in the business of curation, we want to empower as many people around the world as possible. Nothing proves this better than the fact that we not only allowed, but often recognized that we had <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/startsomegood-com?website_name=StartSomeGood\">another crowdfunding platform</a> use Indiegogo to raise money to launch.</p><p>So if the rules were up to us, given our inclusive approach and equal-opportunity philosophy, we would opt for a more open environment where platforms could innovate and compete freely to prove themselves superior, even if that meant more competition for us.</p><h5><b>Despite Delays, Crowdfunding Continues To Grow</b></h5><p>At Indiegogo, we&#8217;re excited to see the SEC release the rules. However, even without equity crowdfunding, new businesses have continued to thrive on Indiegogo. In the last year since the JOBS Act passed, more than 15,000 entrepreneurial campaigns raised money on Indiegogo in the U.S. alone.</p><p>Businesses like the first package-free grocery store <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/in-gredients?website_name=ingredients\">In.gredients</a> raised $15,000 to open its doors. Due to the market validation from crowdfunding, now traditional financiers are calling the team to ask how they can help the business expand. Innovative products like the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/1-face-watch\">1:Face Watch,</a> raised more than $357,000 to bring their watch to market, while giving people the opportunity to support the cause of their choice. Due to the risk-mitigation benefits of crowdfunding, the team didn’t face the risk of overproduction or underproduction.</p><p>Shareconomy ventures like the mobile canning service for craft brewers <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/get-the-can-van-rolling?website_name=The-Can-Van\">The Can Van</a> also benefitted by garnering publicity they never could have imagined through their campaign. Due to social media integration, crowdfunding helped this team turn supporters into grassroots marketers overnight.</p><p>These job-creating endeavors and their entrepreneurial neighbors on Indiegogo received money from more than 200,000 people across all 50 states who voted with their dollars to bring these ideas to life. This clearly demonstrates how crowdfunding provides a catalyst not just for funding, but for traction, awareness and market validation as well.  I wonder what the numbers would be when equity is part of the picture &#8212; when the JOBS Act turns two. Exciting times are ahead. History in the making.</p><br /><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/793242/\"></a><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=iuWJbbe253I:WUpqcUSq1lo:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=iuWJbbe253I:WUpqcUSq1lo:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=iuWJbbe253I:WUpqcUSq1lo:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=iuWJbbe253I:WUpqcUSq1lo:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=iuWJbbe253I:WUpqcUSq1lo:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=iuWJbbe253I:WUpqcUSq1lo:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=iuWJbbe253I:WUpqcUSq1lo:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=iuWJbbe253I:WUpqcUSq1lo:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/iuWJbbe253I\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/05/crowdfunding-industry-celebrates-first-anniversary-of-jobs-act-despite-delays/feed/") (slash:comments nil "0") (media:thumbnail ((url .

DoorJamz provides a solution for both of these problems. It’s still a doorbell, but instead of the consistently infuriating “ding-dong”, you can choose to have it play whatever you like. If can have <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://t.co/BSQiyg2NBx\">Led Zeppelin’s Kashmir</a> play whenever your guests or the Jehovah Witnesses announce their presence. That's pretty cool.

That&#8217;s pretty cool.</p><p>The DoorJamz is controlled from an app on your smartphone. Once a particular song or sound file is uploaded unto the app, it wirelessly transmits your new doortone to the DoorJamz.</p><p>From the app, you can also schedule to have certain doortones ring on certain days. For example, on Halloween you can set your DoorJamz to play a howling wolf, a cackling witch, or maybe an audio recording of you screaming “I DON’T HAVE CANDY” followed by a long string of curses whenever those trick or treaters come to call.</p><p>But the best feature, and one parents everywhere will appreciate, is that you can lower the DoorJamz’s volume whenever you want. So if your baby is napping during the day, you can basically mute the DoorJamz until they wake up. It&#8217;s insane that the doorbells we have now can&#8217;t do this.</p><p>A DoorJamz can be had for a $99 contribution at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/doorjamz-customizable-doortone-for-your-home\">their IndieGogo page</a>.

The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://breathometer.com\">Breathometer</a>, which is currently for sale through a campaign on Indiegogo, was built to use the processing power of your mobile phone to provide an affordable way to allow users to check their blood alcohol content. And I got to take it for a spin.</p><p>Breathometer founder Charles Michael Yim said that he had tried a few different consumer breathalyzers and found none of them were all that convenient. They were too bulky, too expensive, and cumbersome in terms of having to calibrate them. Most people are probably not aware of the availability of consumer breathalyzers, and so Yim and his team decided to make a device that was more affordable and accessible for the average consumer.</p><p>The Breathometer is available as part of an <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/breathometer-a-smartphone-breathalyzer\">Indiegogo campaign</a> that the company is running now through April 13. It&#8217;s structured in a way that how soon you&#8217;ll receive a device depends on how much you contribute. So someone who contributes $100 will be part of the company&#8217;s first drop-shipment of the device in July, whereas someone who puts in just $20 shouldn&#8217;t expect the device before early next year.</p><p>I had a few drinks ahead of the interview, to try the thing out for myself, and, well, for science. What I found was that the Breathometer was accurate in establishing that Yim was stone-cold sober, while I blew a 0.04. And while that means I was probably ok to drive, maybe I shouldn&#8217;t have been conducting a video interview under the influence. Whew.

They&#8217;re all active Tumblr users themselves, and were inspired to build Babblr because of their own passion for Tumblr and social media in general.</p><p>According to Babblr co-founder Brandon Sowers, between himself and Babblr&#8217;s other creators, Brett Williams and Trevor Clarke, they have a combined 700,000 Tumblr followers. &#8221;We&#8217;re always looking at new, innovative ways to communicate with our fans,&#8221; says Sowers.</p><p>Today, Tumblr&#8217;s social features are more lightweight &#8211; its users can follow others&#8217; blogs, favorite posts, and re-blog content while adding their own 2 cents, but direct communication between users isn&#8217;t possible.</p><p>&#8220;People want to communicate in realtime with their followers,&#8221; Sowers explains, &#8220;and this is a great tool for that.&#8221;</p><p>Babblr isn&#8217;t overly complex software. It&#8217;s not that much different from other on-site chat clients, in fact. The difference is that it&#8217;s built on top of the Tumblr API, and through a Chrome extension launching in a few weeks, it will integrate directly into your Tumblr dashboard.</p><p><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/05/sneak-peek-babblr-readies-a-real-time-chat-client-for-tumblr/babblr/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-793204\"></a></p><p>After authenticating with Tumblr, the Babblr interface shows you a list of followers and those you&#8217;re following, and lets you initiate instant messaging-like chats with others on Babblr. You can also organize your followers into groups, which is useful for those with larger communities, or who just want to have more directed conversations.</p><p>The messaging app is designed to be family-friendly, too, as it censors curse words by turning them into silly or nonsense phrases like &#8220;fudge this&#8221; or &#8220;schmeggs.&#8221; (The F word and S word, respectively.)</p><p>The Babblr team has been working on the client for about six months, and as of two months ago, they allowed people to discover it on their own through search and other posted links, in order to try it out. As of now, Babblr has 25,000 users who have since done so. In fact, a post teasing the client&#8217;s development which Williams posted to his own Tumblr blog ended up with more than 200,000 &#8220;notes.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;We got 25,000 emails that day from people wanting whatever this chat was at the time,&#8221; says Sowers. &#8220;It&#8217;s pretty insane when you see something like that,&#8221; he adds.</p><p>Of the now 25,000 users who have set up Babblr accounts, the majority of them are female, ages 16 through 24 &#8211; something which lends support to reports of Tumblr&#8217;s popularity among a younger demographic. Around 80 percent of those who signed up are also U.S.-based.</p><p>Today&#8217;s &#8220;launch&#8221; of Babblr is still really more of a sneak peek than it is a public debut. The client is in beta and won&#8217;t be available on Tumblr dashboards until the Chrome extension is finished up. But Sowers says that part is almost done.</p><p>When Babblr launches in a couple of weeks, it will be free to download, but the plan is to shortly thereafter begin charging a 99-cent fee for the download after word spreads.</p><p>All three co-founders still work at Sevenly and are bootstrapping the project with their own &#8220;passion, sweat and tears,&#8221; says Sowers.</p><p>You can <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://babblr.me/\">test out Babblr for yourself here</a>.

As it is seeking &#8220;new digital publishing models,&#8221; the merger has been widely commented on as a way to counter Amazon&#8217;s influence on the ebook market.</p><p>Penguin Random House will become the world&#8217;s largest publisher, ahead of book publishers &#8212; Hachette, HarperCollins, Macmillan and Simon &amp; Schuster in size. Bertelsmann will own 53 percent of the new entity, while Pearson will own the remaining 47 percent. With only five major publishers left, the book industry will get much more traction against distributors, such as Amazon, traditional bookstores and ebook retailers (Kindle Store, Nook Book Store, Apple&#8217;s iBooks Store).</p><p>The <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/13/with-doj-suit-still-in-play-apple-and-four-big-publishers-settle-price-fixing-probe-in-europe/\">price-fixing case</a> against those major publishers and Apple was widely commented. According to the DOJ, Apple&#8217;s introduction of iBooks led to a price increase in the ebook market because Apple signed an agreement with publishers.</p><p>The so-called agency model partially disappeared with the settlement of Apple and those book publishers. Book publishers now have a very thin margin to negotiate with Amazon to increase ebook pricing. According to publishers, the $9.99 standard created with the introduction of the first Kindle is not enough for newly released bestsellers.</p><p>That&#8217;s why the Penguin and Random House merger makes sense. The new entity will leverage its size to dictate its own terms. The company could even create a new distribution channel, with exclusive content from Penguin Random House. In other words, it could create a publisher-owned Kindle Store competitor, something that is highly needed to end Amazon&#8217;s dominance on the ebook market.</p><p>Comparatively, the music industry now only works with three major companies, Sony Music Entertainment, Universal Music Group and Warner Music Group. <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2009/03/26/popular-songs-on-itunes-go-to-129-on-april-7/\">Back in 2009</a>, those companies managed to end the $0.99 price tag on the iTunes Store to introduce more flexibility. Popular songs now sell for up to $1.29.</p><p>The first attempt to create an agency model in the ebook industry failed because Amazon didn&#8217;t play ball and Apple benefited from better terms from the publishers. If Penguin Random House threatens to remove its entire catalog from the Kindle Store, Amazon will have no choice but to agree to higher prices again.</p><p><i>(Photo credit: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/47962221@N07/6938212507/\">Tracey Tutt</a>)</i></p><br /><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/793076/\"></a><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Ad2tNCPt7pk:Ix_-Dh2lpbg:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Ad2tNCPt7pk:Ix_-Dh2lpbg:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Ad2tNCPt7pk:Ix_-Dh2lpbg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Ad2tNCPt7pk:Ix_-Dh2lpbg:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=Ad2tNCPt7pk:Ix_-Dh2lpbg:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Ad2tNCPt7pk:Ix_-Dh2lpbg:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=Ad2tNCPt7pk:Ix_-Dh2lpbg:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Ad2tNCPt7pk:Ix_-Dh2lpbg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/Ad2tNCPt7pk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/05/penguin-random-house-the-worlds-largest-book-publisher-that-will-counter-amazon/feed/") (slash:comments nil "0") (media:thumbnail ((url .

Lobbies leverage a group&#8217;s reputation and resources to push political messages, almost by definition. Nor is using the tech community&#8217;s captive audience of billions of users particularly novel. Beyond the SOPA protests, Google exploits its website to promote marriage equality (<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/25/googles-heart-warming-videos-supporting-marriage-equality-laws-this-election/\">with adorable videos</a>)</p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/yfLa1-2zBuI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span><p>To a lesser extent, tech companies attempt to influence behavior. Facebook encourages users to vote and <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/01/facebook-wants-us-to-save-lives-through-organ-donation-will-we-follow-through/\">be an organ donor</a>. Apple used to plaster &#8220;don&#8217;t steal music&#8221; on iPods. Perhaps even more transparent, the Bay Area (i.e Silicon Valley) <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/Bay-Area-money-fills-Obama-campaign-coffers-4005151.php\">funneled more cash</a> to President Obama&#8217;s campaign than either Los Angeles (Hollywood) or New York (Wall Street).</p><p>Moreover, there are plenty of existing tech lobbies, such as The Internet Association, Engine Advocacy, TechNet, The Silicon Valley Leadership Group, and the Consumer Electronic Association, all with nearly identical support for more high skilled immigrant visas.</p><p>The memo&#8217;s language is brazen, for sure, and reveals that tech CEOs are aware of their own power. The group was supposed to launch this month, right before a draft of a comprehensive immigration reform bill hits Congress for debate. I suspect that everything is still on track, because no one in Washington DC will be surprised that people want to use money and power to influence law.</p><br /><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/793136/\"></a><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=kSCqCwwjSeM:G0AT0F6aTE0:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=kSCqCwwjSeM:G0AT0F6aTE0:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=kSCqCwwjSeM:G0AT0F6aTE0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=kSCqCwwjSeM:G0AT0F6aTE0:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=kSCqCwwjSeM:G0AT0F6aTE0:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=kSCqCwwjSeM:G0AT0F6aTE0:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=kSCqCwwjSeM:G0AT0F6aTE0:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=kSCqCwwjSeM:G0AT0F6aTE0:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/kSCqCwwjSeM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/05/zuckerbergs-political-lobby-has-nothing-to-regret-in-leaked-memo/feed/") (slash:comments nil "0") (media:thumbnail ((url .

If the flick in question has already been added to the Pegleg collection you can watch it immediately. In the extremely likely event that the movie you&#8217;ve been jonesing for isn&#8217;t there yet, Pegleg will display a list of YouTube videos it thinks could be what you&#8217;re after, along with a little notification showing you how sure it&#8217;s actually a full-length movie based on the clip&#8217;s running time.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/pegleg2.png\"></a></p><p>Right now Pegleg plays home to nearly 900 YouTube movie links that users have added to the system, with some of them naturally worth more of your time than others. It&#8217;s a remarkably polished project especially considering that Pegleg&#8217;s creator, Toronto-based developer <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://fightingtheboss.com/\">Mina Mikhail</a>, was mainly looking for a way to get better acquainted with developing in<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://meteor.com/\"> Meteor</a>. Still, as neat as the project is, it&#8217;s very possible that by shining a light on all of these films lurking on YouTube Mikhail is actually making them (and potentially event Pegleg itself) a more prominent target for copyright takedowns. Over the past few days alone some 20 links were removed from Pegleg because the films they pointed to were removed by YouTube.</p><p>As far as Mikhail is concerned though, that&#8217;s just the nature of the beast. Takedowns can and will happen, but he finds it unlikely that these sorts of film uploads will ever completely disappear from YouTube. As some films are unceremoniously yanked from YouTube, others will certainly be uploaded in their place, and the ceaseless dance between copyright holders and YouTube-savvy film buffs continues on.

However, as each notice is processed, Google posts the request along with pertinent statistics and links. This, as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://torrentfreak.com/fox-wants-google-to-take-down-its-own-takedown-request-130404/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Torrentfreak+%28Torrentfreak%29\">TorrentFreak notes</a>, has essentially created a search engine for piracy where pirate websites can be sussed out with a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.google.com/#hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;q=site:chillingeffects.org+hobbit&amp;oq=site:chillingeffects.org+hobbit&amp;gs_l=serp.3...1276185.1276953.0.1277175.6.6.0.0.0.0.279.693.4j1j1.6.0...0.0...1c.1.8.psy-ab.Ss4305FzoAk&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_qf.&amp;fp=5a6b6c721a7ed2d2&amp;biw=1326&amp;bih=666\">few keystrokes</a>.<br /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/fox-chilling.png\"></a><br />
The takedown notices seem to automatically generated so I doubt the rightsholders even know what they&#8217;re asking let alone the irony of their requests. The ChillingEffects links are still accessible via Google because, as we well know, they only mention the takedown notices themselves and don&#8217;t host the content.</p><p>As this process becomes more and more automated, it becomes a stranger and stranger world. Given that many of these systems are robots, it&#8217;s a race of robot vs. robot for the takedowns and, sometimes, the robots turn on each other. We, at the very least, live in interesting times.</p><br /><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/792919/\"></a><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=inIX_pAmWcA:tO7KUZQ0Gwc:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=inIX_pAmWcA:tO7KUZQ0Gwc:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=inIX_pAmWcA:tO7KUZQ0Gwc:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=inIX_pAmWcA:tO7KUZQ0Gwc:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=inIX_pAmWcA:tO7KUZQ0Gwc:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=inIX_pAmWcA:tO7KUZQ0Gwc:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=inIX_pAmWcA:tO7KUZQ0Gwc:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=inIX_pAmWcA:tO7KUZQ0Gwc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/inIX_pAmWcA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/05/copyright-holders-ask-google-to-take-down-their-own-takedown-notices/feed/") (slash:comments nil "0") (media:thumbnail ((url .

It is a massive market that has been lacking in technology innovation for some time,&#8221; said Burkhart. &#8220;We are focused on perfecting our operations as we continue to open in new markets, so that we can continue to provide a world-class product and service to our customers.&#8221;</p><br /><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/828442/\"></a><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=IXfZqrObRk0:2jbQsNuolj0:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=IXfZqrObRk0:2jbQsNuolj0:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=IXfZqrObRk0:2jbQsNuolj0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=IXfZqrObRk0:2jbQsNuolj0:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=IXfZqrObRk0:2jbQsNuolj0:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=IXfZqrObRk0:2jbQsNuolj0:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=IXfZqrObRk0:2jbQsNuolj0:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=IXfZqrObRk0:2jbQsNuolj0:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/IXfZqrObRk0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://techcrunch.com/2013/06/06/h-bloom-floral-service-preps-to-launch-in-5-new-cities-starting-with-boston-on-june-11/feed/") (slash:comments nil "0") (media:thumbnail ((url .

Connecting with social networks like Facebook can help for distribution, and you can sell your app in Apple’s App Store and Google Play or make money via ads. But in the enterprise world, this is a challenge that any mobile or web app developer faces. Today, cloud storage company Box is hoping to solve this problem for developers by debuting Box $rev, a new program for developers to monetize their applications on the Box platform.</p><p>“This is really about how we can drive value for both developers and users,” explains CEO and co-founder Aaron Levie. He says that enterprise apps do not monetize well in the App Store or other mobile app platforms, and this is going to provide a way for enterprise app developers who are building off of Box to actually make revenue from users interacting with their apps. “This is the easiest way for enterprise app developers to make money,” claims Levie.</p><p>With Box $rev, developers are paid when a Box Business or Enterprise customer uses a third-party app that’s integrated with Box. Box $rev, via a new SDK developers must use, will measure customer interactions with third-party apps integrated on Box and compensate developers based on that usage. Based on usage, developers can be paid up to 15 percent of the Box seat price ( which can range from $10 per month upwards) per user. If an entire organization with 10,000 seats downloads a specific app, that could be meaningful revenue for the developers. It also provides a way for Box to see which apps its users are interacting with the most.</p><p>“We’re rewriting the rules when it comes to supporting the next generation of enterprise app developers,” says Levie.</p><p>Box $rev is launching today with ten inaugural Box OneCloud partners including CloudOn, Notability, Documents by Readdle, PDFExpert, iAnnotate, Genius Scan, CamScanner, Outline+, GoodNotes and SmartOffice. Over time, Box $rev will expand to a broader set of programs and capabilities, the company explains.</p><p>Box is also releasing new SDKs for Android and IOS that add the ability for users to select Box files through a secure file picker with only a few lines of code. Box has also added built-in SSO support to easily manage enterprise identity.</p><p>At the heart of what Box is doing is trying to create a broader economy around its API and developer ecosystem.

Connecting with social networks like Facebook can help for distribution, and you can sell your app in Apple&#8217;s App Store and Google Play or make money via ads. But in the enterprise world, this is a challenge that any mobile or web app developer faces. Today, cloud storage company Box is hoping to solve this problem for developers by debuting Box $rev, a new program for developers to monetize their applications on the Box platform.</p><p>&#8220;This is really about how we can drive value for both developers and users,&#8221; explains CEO and co-founder Aaron Levie. He says that enterprise apps do not monetize well in the App Store or other mobile app platforms, and this is going to provide a way for enterprise app developers who are building off of Box to actually make revenue from users interacting with their apps. &#8220;This is the easiest way for enterprise app developers to make money,&#8221; claims Levie.</p><p>With Box $rev, developers are paid when a Box Business or Enterprise customer uses a third-party app that&#8217;s integrated with Box. Box $rev, via a new SDK developers must use, will measure customer interactions with third-party apps integrated on Box and compensate developers based on that usage. Based on usage, developers can be paid up to 15 percent of the Box seat price ( which can range from $10 per month upwards) per user. If an entire organization with 10,000 seats downloads a specific app, that could be meaningful revenue for the developers. It also provides a way for Box to see which apps its users are interacting with the most.</p><p>“We’re rewriting the rules when it comes to supporting the next generation of enterprise app developers,” says Levie.</p><p>Box $rev is launching today with ten inaugural Box OneCloud partners including CloudOn, Notability, Documents by Readdle, PDFExpert, iAnnotate, Genius Scan, CamScanner, Outline+, GoodNotes and SmartOffice. Over time, Box $rev will expand to a broader set of programs and capabilities, the company explains.</p><p>Box is also releasing new SDKs for Android and IOS that add the ability for users to select Box files through a secure file picker with only a few lines of code. Box has also added built-in SSO support to easily manage enterprise identity.</p><p>At the heart of what Box is doing is trying to create a broader economy around its API and developer ecosystem. Box $rev could be a super interesting way to not only attract more developers to build off of Box, but also gain additional insight into how its business and enterprise users are interacting with additional functions and apps leveraging the cloud storage platforms. Today, the Box OneCloud ecosystem includes more than 500 app integrations, including drchrono, SmartOffice and Documents by Readdle.

The platform’s growth is perhaps most interesting in that nearly half of it has taken place since the launch of Twitter’s Vine video-focused mobile social networking app.</p><p>Vine, if you recall, just recently <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/06/03/twitter-releases-vine-for-android-smartphones-tops-13m-users/\">announced that it has managed to rack up 13 million users on iOS</a>, the only platform where it had been available since late January, prior to its launch on Android this week. That means that Keek has added almost double the number of users that Vine has managed in the past few months, a fact which has not escaped the notice of Keek founder and CEO Isaac Raichyk.</p><p>“Our growth has accelerated during the same period that Vine’s been active,” he said. “We believe the next couple of years is when social video will rule, and we’re definitely leading the space.” If anything, it seems like Vine’s launch has raised the profile of social video in general, which might be contributing to the rapid growth of Keek’s user base, though there are other factors also at work according to Raichyk.</p><p>It’s worth noting that Vine so far is on only two platforms, with one just launched, while Keek is on Android, iPhone, BlackBerry and the desktop, with a Windows Phone client likely in the works as well. Still, Keek’s recent growth is impressive, and to Raichyk at least, it looks like the user community is generally more willing to adopt mobile social video tools than it has been in the past.</p><p>“It seems that there was a tipping point,” he said, explaining the driving factors behind the recent uptick. “We’re very focused on making it easy to communicate via social video, we built a whole brand to encourage social interaction. It seems that in different geographic areas, concentration just keeps growing, and at some point you just have enough content, the community is large enough for things to tip and take off.”</p><p>One of the contributing factors behind Keek’s growth that Raichyk had mentioned in the past when discussing his company’s<a title=\"Keek Raises $18M, Adds 6M Users In 30 Days And Looks To Expand Mobile Video Sharing Further Internationally\" href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/17/keek-raises-18m-adds-6m-users-in-30-days-and-looks-to-expand-mobile-video-sharing-further-internationally/\"> recent $18 million funding round</a> has been celebrity support, but it’s still only accounting for a fraction of the service’s engagement. Around 20 percent of the total Keeks viewed come from celebrities, and the rest of the growth is still bottom-up, the way it has been since the service’s launch.</p><p>Last time I wrote about Keek I suggested that video sharing on mobile had yet to achieve an “Instagram” moment. Now, helped along by Vine, and with this tremendous recent growth in interest in Keek, it seems like that moment may have arrived. Besides the 45 million users, Keek has also seen over 667 million visits, offered up 12 billion page views, with 18 million total videos posted and 2.2 billion playbacks of said videos.

The platform&#8217;s growth is perhaps most interesting in that nearly half of it has taken place since the launch of Twitter&#8217;s Vine video-focused mobile social networking app.</p><p>Vine, if you recall, just recently <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/06/03/twitter-releases-vine-for-android-smartphones-tops-13m-users/\">announced that it has managed to rack up 13 million users on iOS</a>, the only platform where it had been available since late January, prior to its launch on Android this week. That means that Keek has added almost double the number of users that Vine has managed in the past few months, a fact which has not escaped the notice of Keek founder and CEO Isaac Raichyk.</p><p>&#8220;Our growth has accelerated during the same period that Vine&#8217;s been active,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We believe the next couple of years is when social video will rule, and we&#8217;re definitely leading the space.&#8221; If anything, it seems like Vine&#8217;s launch has raised the profile of social video in general, which might be contributing to the rapid growth of Keek&#8217;s user base, though there are other factors also at work according to Raichyk.</p><p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Vine so far is on only two platforms, with one just launched, while Keek is on Android, iPhone, BlackBerry and the desktop, with a Windows Phone client likely in the works as well. Still, Keek&#8217;s recent growth is impressive, and to Raichyk at least, it looks like the user community is generally more willing to adopt mobile social video tools than it has been in the past.</p><p>&#8220;It seems that there was a tipping point,&#8221; he said, explaining the driving factors behind the recent uptick. &#8220;We&#8217;re very focused on making it easy to communicate via social video, we built a whole brand to encourage social interaction. It seems that in different geographic areas, concentration just keeps growing, and at some point you just have enough content, the community is large enough for things to tip and take off.&#8221;</p><p>One of the contributing factors behind Keek&#8217;s growth that Raichyk had mentioned in the past when discussing his company&#8217;s<a title=\"Keek Raises $18M, Adds 6M Users In 30 Days And Looks To Expand Mobile Video Sharing Further Internationally\" href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/17/keek-raises-18m-adds-6m-users-in-30-days-and-looks-to-expand-mobile-video-sharing-further-internationally/\"> recent $18 million funding round</a> has been celebrity support, but it&#8217;s still only accounting for a fraction of the service&#8217;s engagement. Around 20 percent of the total Keeks viewed come from celebrities, and the rest of the growth is still bottom-up, the way it has been since the service&#8217;s launch.</p><p>Last time I wrote about Keek I suggested that video sharing on mobile had yet to achieve an &#8220;Instagram&#8221; moment. Now, helped along by Vine, and with this tremendous recent growth in interest in Keek, it seems like that moment may have arrived. Besides the 45 million users, Keek has also seen over 667 million visits, offered up 12 billion page views, with 18 million total videos posted and 2.2 billion playbacks of said videos.

By doing so, it not only uses your Facebook profile data as noted above, it can also help you discover who among your network is a reader like you.</p><p>“We weren’t sure whether or not ‘friends’ represents the same correlation of books that you may like as well, so we spent a lot of time integrating some very interesting technology that exposes who are the friends that you have that actually have very common interests,” Brady says. The service uses responsive ratings – by asking you if you <em>love</em>, <em>like</em>, or <em>hate</em> a book, it finds others who have rated those books in the same way. But this system can also help users figure out who in your network may want to discuss a book, too – someone who loves “Life of Pi” for example, could have an interesting debate with someone who claims to hate it.</p><p>With Slice Bookshelf now taking advantage of the startup’s core technology, the question is whether or not Slice will be taking on other verticals like movies or music in the future. Though that’s not something the company is ruling out, its next step is actually to beef up its main application Slice with more “Google Now”-like predictive capabilities instead. Having already been one of the first to use the concept of inbox-scanning technology to help unearth hidden data trends, Brady says it’s time to evolve that concept further, and the company plans to upgrade Slice with new features and core capabilities soon.</p><p>In the meantime, Slice Bookshelf is available as a web-only (but generally mobile-optimized) service to start, with plans to debut native apps in the future.</p><br /><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/828493/\"></a><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=nUif9TaQz-A:_xMzV4MZqKc:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=nUif9TaQz-A:_xMzV4MZqKc:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=nUif9TaQz-A:_xMzV4MZqKc:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=nUif9TaQz-A:_xMzV4MZqKc:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=nUif9TaQz-A:_xMzV4MZqKc:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=nUif9TaQz-A:_xMzV4MZqKc:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=nUif9TaQz-A:_xMzV4MZqKc:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=nUif9TaQz-A:_xMzV4MZqKc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/nUif9TaQz-A\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>" "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/nUif9TaQz-A/" (20912 42130) old 13 nil nil ((title nil "Eric Schmidt-Backed Slice Moves Beyond Receipt Tracking With Debut Of Bookshelf, A Social Network For Readers") (link nil "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/nUif9TaQz-A/") (comments nil "http://techcrunch.com/2013/06/06/eric-schmidt-backed-slice-moves-beyond-receipt-tracking-with-debut-of-bookshelf-a-social-network-for-readers/#comments") (pubDate nil "Thu, 06 Jun 2013 15:02:42 +0000") (dc:creator nil "Sarah Perez") (category nil "Social") (category nil "Startups") (category nil "TC") (category nil "amazon") (category nil "books") (category nil "bookshelf") (category nil "e-books") (category nil "goodreads") (category nil "reading") (category nil "slice") (category nil "social") (guid ((isPermaLink .

Though that&#8217;s not something the company is ruling out, its next step is actually to beef up its main application Slice with more &#8220;Google Now&#8221;-like predictive capabilities instead. Having already been one of the first to use the concept of inbox-scanning technology to help unearth hidden data trends, Brady says it&#8217;s time to evolve that concept further, and the company plans to upgrade Slice with new features and core capabilities soon.</p><p>In the meantime, Slice Bookshelf is available as a web-only (but generally mobile-optimized) service to start, with plans to debut native apps in the future.</p><br /><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/828493/\"></a><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=nUif9TaQz-A:_xMzV4MZqKc:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=nUif9TaQz-A:_xMzV4MZqKc:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=nUif9TaQz-A:_xMzV4MZqKc:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=nUif9TaQz-A:_xMzV4MZqKc:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=nUif9TaQz-A:_xMzV4MZqKc:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=nUif9TaQz-A:_xMzV4MZqKc:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=nUif9TaQz-A:_xMzV4MZqKc:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=nUif9TaQz-A:_xMzV4MZqKc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/nUif9TaQz-A\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://techcrunch.com/2013/06/06/eric-schmidt-backed-slice-moves-beyond-receipt-tracking-with-debut-of-bookshelf-a-social-network-for-readers/feed/") (slash:comments nil "0") (media:thumbnail ((url .

A 99.95% uptime means Amazon expects about 22 minutes per instance per month.

Simply put, the app is less about learning to read, and more about sparking children&#8217;s creativity and imagination, Xie says.</p><p><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/06/06/to-spark-childrens-imaginations-hullabalu-raises-1-8-million-from-sv-angel-great-oaks-others-for-ipad-storytelling-app/screenshots-2/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-828621\"></a></p><p>In addition to the story itself, kids can also launch a photo booth app from the homescreen for a little bit of extra fun.

I hate to use the word clone, but… clone.</p><p>The app is called Wan-Pai, (or Wanpai, we’re not really sure due to complexities in the translation from Mandarin) which seems to mean “Beat” based on the various translations Google is giving me. (It could also mean Play Racket, Play Shoot, or “to play Mahjong”.) The app lets you record video in the same manner as Vine, by holding a finger to the screen to record, and letting go to pause.</p><p>Here’s the official wording from the site (as translated by Google):</p><blockquote><p>Press and hold anywhere on the screen to start shooting, let go pause, then press and hold to continue shooting, it’s that simple. Shooting clips simultaneously, easy magic effect!</p></blockquote><p>It gets even more intense with the ability to add filters, choose to include or mute audio, and decide the direction the video will play in (forward only, backward only, or in a forward and backward loop).</p><a href='http://techcrunch.com/2013/06/06/youtube-founders-hurley-and-chen-have-released-an-asian-clone-of-vine/photo-jun-06-11-51-10-am/' title='Photo Jun 06, 11 51 10 AM'></a><a href='http://techcrunch.com/2013/06/06/youtube-founders-hurley-and-chen-have-released-an-asian-clone-of-vine/photo-jun-06-11-51-15-am/' title='Photo Jun 06, 11 51 15 AM'></a><a href='http://techcrunch.com/2013/06/06/youtube-founders-hurley-and-chen-have-released-an-asian-clone-of-vine/photo-jun-06-11-52-20-am/' title='Photo Jun 06, 11 52 20 AM'></a><a href='http://techcrunch.com/2013/06/06/youtube-founders-hurley-and-chen-have-released-an-asian-clone-of-vine/photo-jun-06-11-52-52-am/' title='Photo Jun 06, 11 52 52 AM'></a><p>The camera itself is very similar to Vine, boxing off the camera window against a grey background, and showing your progress bar (on the top instead of the bottom, but still). And the most offensive rip-off would be the six second limit, which is present on both apps (even if a <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/06/03/vine-gets-rickrolld/\">16-year old can get around it</a>).</p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='480' height='360' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/NlGNNxIYfc4?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span><p>The content stream is also very Vine-like, except for the salmon theme color instead of Vine green. It shows an Instagram-style vertical feed of one clip after the other.
