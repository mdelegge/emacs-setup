Titled Abstract No.3, it will expand on the series' twitchy, path-weaving gameplay and will be the team's first commercial release. </p><p>Abstract No.3 is a collection of artistically styled games \"that allow the player to explore how shape, texture, colour, sound, music and player interaction drive and create new experiences,\" explains Oliver Clarke to IndieGames. \"The game will be released in parts, the first of which will be called Abstract No3: Kandinsky's Violin. It will feature unique art in the style of the great abstract artist Wassily Kandinsky. It will respond to player interactions in new ways bringing something new never seen before to both Games and Art.\"</p><p>I asked Oliver about some of the features of the upcoming sequel, bound for \"multiple popular platforms.\" He politely replied and even shared a competition-winning drawing that will be featured as a level in the game, after the jump.</p>" "<p><b>How does the art come to life through animation and movement throughout the game?</b></p><p>By making smart use of the animators arsenal of translations, rotations, scrolling UV's & special effects, every scene in the game will be moving and challenging the player to question what they're seeing literally and emotionally. </p><p><b>Could you explain the notion of \"how you play will affect the game to create mind bending experiences?\"</b></p><p>The game will be very easy to pick up and play and very gradually introduce multiple game mechanics to show the player new perspectives on multiple scenes in an effort to challenge the player to question what they're seeing in the game and hopefully in the real world. The game world will respond to how the player chooses to interact with it, taking them on a journey of their own choice driven by their own mood. Our aim is to have the game create an emotional response through abstract art. </p><p><b>It's a \"collection of games\" you say and sequel to Cat/Milk. Wasn't the first just one game (rather, one core game mechanic) with several stages/variations? How will the sequel be different?</b></p><p>Abstract No.3 is the best bits of The Cat that Got the Milk, specifically the parts people told us they loved and of course add many more levels than the original game. There will be much more movement and animation in the game scenes to create art works that vividly come to life. Combined with the sound and music, we're hoping to create an emotional resonance with the player. </p><p>The game play will be easy to pick up and play but hard to master. We'll introduce new mechanics that explore the worlds we create in new ways from jagged diagonal movements to first person exploration of abstract art works inspired by the style of one of the first true abstract artists Wassily Kandinsky. We plan to create more parts of Abstract No.3 that explore different art styles. Kandinskys Violin is part one. </p><p><img alt=\"ShaneShepardsConcept.JPG\" src=\"http://indiegames.com/ShaneShepardsConcept.JPG\" width=\"478\" class=\"mt-image-center\" style=\"text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;\" /><br /><b>How about another piece of art from the game, Ollie?</b></p><p>I went to Game City to do a talk on our first two games the other night.

But for those that are interested in the intimacy of tangible experiences with the broad possibility of digital games, there's still more areas to explore.</p><p>What can the instant access to the digital realm offered by mobile devices do to support in-person physical games? That's the question London-based game design studio Hide&Seek is heartily pursuing with its latest app, <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1755218595/tiny-games-hundreds-of-real-world-games-inside-you\">Kickstarter-funded <i>Tiny Games</i></a>, a collection of interactive rulesets for hundreds of small folk games people can play together from anywhere, anytime.</p><p>Hide&Seek has a heritage in real-world games -- it's run Edinburgh's <a href=\"http://thenewyeargames.com/\">New Year Games</a>, which played host to more than 10,000 people, and the multi-day <a href=\"http://weekender.hideandseek.net/\">South Bank Festival</a>. It began exploring tiny games with a pilot project in London two years ago, and then as a big campaign as part of the cultural activity around the city's Olympic Games that saw three different tiny games ready to be discovered in each of the 33 boroughs. </p><p>Tiny games are stand-alone and site-specific; for example, passersby may happen upon a big vinyl sticker on the sidewalk that encourage people to play in incredibly simple, accessible ways right from that spot: say upon finding one sticker, a person and her companion decide on a vantage point, and then each person picks a stranger in the crowd and tries to see whose choice reaches that point first. Or passing over a little bridge, players can drop sticks into the water off of one side of the bridge and then look over the other edge to see whose stick passes underneath first (\"Pooh Sticks,\" as coined in the Winnie the Pooh novels). There are games designed for friends waiting on a bus, or who've happened upon a fountain -- small, spontaneous experiences of play with easily-grasped rules.</p><p>\"We love those,\" says Hide&Seek's Margaret Robertson. \"We're always going to keep doing those kinds of projects, but it only solves half the problem, in that they're still super site-specific. The next step was really obvious to us, which is the app. How do you make it so that you can always access this kind of play, without losing the specificity?\"</p><p><img alt=\"tiny games.jpg\" src=\"http://indiegames.com/2013/04/03/tiny%20games.jpg\" width=\"478\" class=\"mt-image-center\" style=\"text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;\" />\"If you're used to designing video games, it can be kind of scary,\" Robertson reflects. \"Video games are an amazing machine that makes you whatever you need; if you move the games into the real world, you lose a lot of that control. So what you have to do is use everything around you; people can find a stick, or a traffic light, but you need to know where people are at. And you need to know what kind of people they are; when you run a live gaming event you do a lot of calibrating on the fly.\" </p><p>For the app, the team wanted to avoid making something that risked leaving players bogged down in pages of rules or in filling in forms, but simply allows them to tell the app their circumstances -- where they are, how many friends are along -- and what kind of game they want to play. </p><p>\"Since we came up with the idea, we've been working on the content, the stuff we can generate easily internally. We knew we would do a Kickstarter in terms of the stuff that's expensive: Coding and art design, which is something we couldn't do ourselves.\" </p><p>Mobile-assisted <i>Spaceteam</i>, which friends can play together using voice and interaction anywhere so long as they all have the app on their phone, has received an incredible reception, and simple in-person social games that can be accessed so easily on the fly are going to be in increasing demand, Robertson believes. We spoke to her during PAX, when attendees of the <i>Sportsfriends</i> sessions seemed to come away feeling like they were part of a \"movement.\"</p><p>\"People are really hungering for that kind of face-to-face,\" says Robertson. \"The board game community, the digital community and the live event community are getting really inspired around giving a more democratic kind of thing, and putting a lot of control back into the hands of players and giving them tools to make their own play, rather than entering a world built to [the designer's] specifications.\"</p><p>Many of the tiny games are folk games with specific cultural history, and this can be a way to preserve and share the heritage of play from different places around the world, she believes. \"On one level, we want to popularize them, but we would never want to look like we're trying to take credit for them,\" she says. \"We would love to do what we can to curate and cross-pollinate these games around the world. It's fascinating how much we still don't know about, say, what hopscotch looks like in Thailand. Tech helps you do that more easily.\"</p><p>\"I've learned a lot on line, but the seduction quality in that is you can get so engrossed, and it's starting to make us realize, in a way, that there's a kind of machine-fueled, instant-gratification culture we live in right now,\" says Robertson. She recalls having lost a camera battery just before traveling, and found herself genuinely considering buying a new one for Amazon to ship to her hotel the next day, rather than spending another 10 minutes searching for it. \"That's a terrible impulse,\" she adds.</p><p>\"The other side of the coin when it comes to the wonderful availability where you can read any book, watch any TV show... in some places we're losing those shared experiences. We're not connecting in terms of the culture we're consuming, we're just becoming atomized and divided up.\"</p><p>Using an app to enable people to play together in small, genuinely social ways is part of the trend that rejects the loss of intimacy in internet culture; note how the popularity of Etsy is driven by the economy of handmade content, almost as a response to the insta-consumerism of Amazon and other online storefronts. </p><p>\"I do think there are broader trends; if there weren't, we wouldn't be getting the support for this that we are,\" Robertson says. \"It's not just us 'nerding up on Victorian parlour games.'\"</p><p>Fresh off a successful run of tiny games at PAX and GDC, Robertson says she's felt validated by the unbelievable response and the support of event organizers who get it. In helping with setup, she says PAX organizers even voluntarily got involved in helping playtest some of the games. </p><p>One tiny game especially suitable for the fan conference environment's called \"That's totally Gabe Newell,\" in which a player has to convince a group of others that a random stranger is a famous game developer -- points if one of the strangers actually approaches the supposed 'famous' person for an autograph, for example.</p><p>These are ideas that anyone can think of -- and in fact probably has, from the time kids on long car trips tasked one another with seeing how many license plates from other states they could count. But an infrastructure that inspires people to organize and play tiny games together benefits the trend increasingly favoring accessible in-person interaction, expands any one individual's knowledge of folk games, and therefore pollinates and preserves their heritage.</p><p>Skeptics might say enthusiasts of this in-person movement are just the same 20,000 people showing up to every event. \"We think you're wrong, but we can't prove that yet,\" Robertson asserts. \"This last year and a half, for us, has really been about the opportunity for us to prove that.\"</p><p>[<i>Leigh Alexander wrote this article originally for sister site <a href=\"http://gamasutra.com/view/news/189743/Play_folk_games_on_the_fly_with_Tiny_Games_app.php\">Gamasutra</a></i>]</p>") (feedburner:origLink nil "http://indiegames.com/2013/04/play_folk_games_on_the_fly_wit.html")) (entry nil (title nil "Browser Pick: 'territory annihilation game' Bomberjam by Mark Foster") (link ((rel .

It's something of an unusual journey, but creative director Ian Dallas says important takeaways from his education at USC's Interactive Media division helped him flesh out his vision and create a fully-fledged game with a major publisher.</p><p>In the game, players explore the mysterious world and its storybook narrative by splashing paint on the environment to reveal the shape and detail in its white landscape. As part of his fellowship, he'd make a new prototype every week for faculty advisor Marc Bolas, and <i>The Unfinished Swan</i> came from there.</p><p>\"At the time, I was interested in how people move around space,\" he muses. \"That's what ended up segueing into this whole <i>Unfinished Swan</i>... monstrosity.\" </p><p>The prototype debuted at 2008's Sense of Wonder night, and a YouTube video caught Sony's attention. The students signed a publishing deal, somewhat unusual at the time -- iOS, Android and other indie-friendly platforms were less accessible.</p><p>\"For us, it ended up being a really good decision, because the game we wanted to make was a little bit bigger and lusher, and that's something that really benefited from having a publisher involved,\" Dallas says. More interested in scope and quality than in financial returns, for him it was a good decision. </p><p>The game also came in 400 percent over budget and well behind schedule, he laughs.</p>" "<p>Some of the most important things he learned in school happened outside of the classroom environment,  he says. Having the opportunity to dig into tools like Maya and Microsoft Visual Studio and pushing to use them in new ways was valuable. Fluency with the core tools helped make the world richer in the game's journey from prototype to full game.</p><p>\"Knowing how the tools work... allows you to pivot and solve the problems that come up,\" he says. \"That's where you get into the really interesting territory.\"</p><p>Designing for any kind of larger games means you end up spending most of your time debugging, at least on the programming side. \"You spend a lot of time just tuning, and figuring out how to make things just slightly better, and being really fluent in the tools gives you a better insight into how they work... the more you know, the better.\"</p><p>Being exposed to miscellaneous tools that aren't core to his daily work also helped Dallas. USC sees much cross-pollination between the cinema team and the ineractive entertainment team in terms of understanding and sharing practices for resources like AfterEffects and ProTools. Familiarity with these ended up being \"really valuable.\"</p><p>\"Instead of writing a dock for the animators, I could make... a really crappy thing, but it actually moved around, and it was much more helpful,\" Dallas says of <i>Unfinished Swan</i>'s animated story portions. </p><p>He also learned the importance of negotiation, and suggests strongly identifying what elements are most valuable to you as a developer versus what elements add the most value for the publisher can help with the give-and-take of those deals.</p><p>And having the peer support from the USC scene mattered, both during the development process and during the equally-beneficial festival circuit. The challenges of showing at festivals can also be learning opportunities: \"The first day on the show floor you have 100 people playing the same tiny section of the game, and they're going to break it!\" Dallas says. </p><p>Being able to edit the game on the show floor is \"empowering,\" and allows developers to test out different audience feedback -- and also eases the stress of having a game crash as new people try it for the first time.</p><p>Once the team began to grow and development of <i>Unfinished Swan</i> as a full-fledged game began, Dallas initially wondered if a producer was even needed -- choosing to have one turned out to be the right decision. \"If you don't have somebody to jump on grenades, nobody's going to get any work done,\" he laughs. </p><p>Frequent playtests are clearly good for design, but are also valuable for giving teams a sense of investment in their work. Everyone is motivated to have things ready to share at the next test playthrough. \"Games are a marathon; it's hard to know three miles into the marathon if you're really on pace. But having weekly playtests is a good gut check for you, to see [how] things are coming together. It gives you some fail points, to fail gently.\" </p><p>He advises keeping task management as simple as possible -- using Google Docs and a spreadsheet was available and frictionless for everyone, versus having complicated workflow software. And a weekly team lunch gives the team an opportunity to get out of the office and to bond, and to see one another as people from various disciplines versus fellow employees.</p><p>\"It's interesting how the process of making a game changes when you [pass] around seven or eight people. That was the point it stopped feeling like a family, and a little more like a company. At seven or eight people is where you start to need another layer of management.\" </p><p>This means huge improvements can come late in development: \"At the end of the project, you're like superheroes... and the biggest factor is that you actually know the game you're making, by that point. And you have better tools that do exactly what you need to do for your game,\" Dallas says.</p><p>[<i>Leigh Alexander wrote this article originally for sister site <a href=\"http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/189261/Lessons_from_The_Unfinished_Swans_unique_development_journey.php\">Gamasutra</a></i>]</p>") (feedburner:origLink nil "http://indiegames.com/2013/04/lessons_from_the_unfinished_sw.html")))) ("Release: Evoland, a pixel-to-polygon trip through action-adventure history" "<p><iframe width=\"478\" height=\"269\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/gxBjDGc4YCg?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>Shiro Games' pixel-to-polygon progression through action-adventure history, Evoland, is now available for Mac and Windows on <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/233470/\">Steam</a> and <a href=\"http://www.gog.com/gamecard/evoland\">GOG</a> for $8.99.

But for those that are interested in the intimacy of tangible experiences with the broad possibility of digital games, there's still more areas to explore.</p><p>What can the instant access to the digital realm offered by mobile devices do to support in-person physical games? That's the question London-based game design studio Hide&Seek is heartily pursuing with its latest app, <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1755218595/tiny-games-hundreds-of-real-world-games-inside-you\">Kickstarter-funded <i>Tiny Games</i></a>, a collection of interactive rulesets for hundreds of small folk games people can play together from anywhere, anytime.</p><p>Hide&Seek has a heritage in real-world games -- it's run Edinburgh's <a href=\"http://thenewyeargames.com/\">New Year Games</a>, which played host to more than 10,000 people, and the multi-day <a href=\"http://weekender.hideandseek.net/\">South Bank Festival</a>. It began exploring tiny games with a pilot project in London two years ago, and then as a big campaign as part of the cultural activity around the city's Olympic Games that saw three different tiny games ready to be discovered in each of the 33 boroughs. </p><p>Tiny games are stand-alone and site-specific; for example, passersby may happen upon a big vinyl sticker on the sidewalk that encourage people to play in incredibly simple, accessible ways right from that spot: say upon finding one sticker, a person and her companion decide on a vantage point, and then each person picks a stranger in the crowd and tries to see whose choice reaches that point first. Or passing over a little bridge, players can drop sticks into the water off of one side of the bridge and then look over the other edge to see whose stick passes underneath first (\"Pooh Sticks,\" as coined in the Winnie the Pooh novels). There are games designed for friends waiting on a bus, or who've happened upon a fountain -- small, spontaneous experiences of play with easily-grasped rules.</p><p>\"We love those,\" says Hide&Seek's Margaret Robertson. \"We're always going to keep doing those kinds of projects, but it only solves half the problem, in that they're still super site-specific. The next step was really obvious to us, which is the app. How do you make it so that you can always access this kind of play, without losing the specificity?\"</p><p><img alt=\"tiny games.jpg\" src=\"http://indiegames.com/2013/04/03/tiny%20games.jpg\" width=\"478\" class=\"mt-image-center\" style=\"text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;\" />\"If you're used to designing video games, it can be kind of scary,\" Robertson reflects. \"Video games are an amazing machine that makes you whatever you need; if you move the games into the real world, you lose a lot of that control. So what you have to do is use everything around you; people can find a stick, or a traffic light, but you need to know where people are at. And you need to know what kind of people they are; when you run a live gaming event you do a lot of calibrating on the fly.\" </p><p>For the app, the team wanted to avoid making something that risked leaving players bogged down in pages of rules or in filling in forms, but simply allows them to tell the app their circumstances -- where they are, how many friends are along -- and what kind of game they want to play. </p><p>\"Since we came up with the idea, we've been working on the content, the stuff we can generate easily internally. We knew we would do a Kickstarter in terms of the stuff that's expensive: Coding and art design, which is something we couldn't do ourselves.\" </p><p>Mobile-assisted <i>Spaceteam</i>, which friends can play together using voice and interaction anywhere so long as they all have the app on their phone, has received an incredible reception, and simple in-person social games that can be accessed so easily on the fly are going to be in increasing demand, Robertson believes. We spoke to her during PAX, when attendees of the <i>Sportsfriends</i> sessions seemed to come away feeling like they were part of a \"movement.\"</p><p>\"People are really hungering for that kind of face-to-face,\" says Robertson. \"The board game community, the digital community and the live event community are getting really inspired around giving a more democratic kind of thing, and putting a lot of control back into the hands of players and giving them tools to make their own play, rather than entering a world built to [the designer's] specifications.\"</p><p>Many of the tiny games are folk games with specific cultural history, and this can be a way to preserve and share the heritage of play from different places around the world, she believes. \"On one level, we want to popularize them, but we would never want to look like we're trying to take credit for them,\" she says. \"We would love to do what we can to curate and cross-pollinate these games around the world. It's fascinating how much we still don't know about, say, what hopscotch looks like in Thailand. Tech helps you do that more easily.\"</p><p>\"I've learned a lot on line, but the seduction quality in that is you can get so engrossed, and it's starting to make us realize, in a way, that there's a kind of machine-fueled, instant-gratification culture we live in right now,\" says Robertson. She recalls having lost a camera battery just before traveling, and found herself genuinely considering buying a new one for Amazon to ship to her hotel the next day, rather than spending another 10 minutes searching for it. \"That's a terrible impulse,\" she adds.</p><p>\"The other side of the coin when it comes to the wonderful availability where you can read any book, watch any TV show... in some places we're losing those shared experiences. We're not connecting in terms of the culture we're consuming, we're just becoming atomized and divided up.\"</p><p>Using an app to enable people to play together in small, genuinely social ways is part of the trend that rejects the loss of intimacy in internet culture; note how the popularity of Etsy is driven by the economy of handmade content, almost as a response to the insta-consumerism of Amazon and other online storefronts. </p><p>\"I do think there are broader trends; if there weren't, we wouldn't be getting the support for this that we are,\" Robertson says. \"It's not just us 'nerding up on Victorian parlour games.'\"</p><p>Fresh off a successful run of tiny games at PAX and GDC, Robertson says she's felt validated by the unbelievable response and the support of event organizers who get it. In helping with setup, she says PAX organizers even voluntarily got involved in helping playtest some of the games. </p><p>One tiny game especially suitable for the fan conference environment's called \"That's totally Gabe Newell,\" in which a player has to convince a group of others that a random stranger is a famous game developer -- points if one of the strangers actually approaches the supposed 'famous' person for an autograph, for example.</p><p>These are ideas that anyone can think of -- and in fact probably has, from the time kids on long car trips tasked one another with seeing how many license plates from other states they could count. But an infrastructure that inspires people to organize and play tiny games together benefits the trend increasingly favoring accessible in-person interaction, expands any one individual's knowledge of folk games, and therefore pollinates and preserves their heritage.</p><p>Skeptics might say enthusiasts of this in-person movement are just the same 20,000 people showing up to every event. \"We think you're wrong, but we can't prove that yet,\" Robertson asserts. \"This last year and a half, for us, has really been about the opportunity for us to prove that.\"</p><p>[<i>Leigh Alexander wrote this article originally for sister site <a href=\"http://gamasutra.com/view/news/189743/Play_folk_games_on_the_fly_with_Tiny_Games_app.php\">Gamasutra</a></i>]</p>") (feedburner:origLink nil "http://indiegames.com/2013/04/play_folk_games_on_the_fly_wit.html"))) ("Browser Pick: 'territory annihilation game' Bomberjam by Mark Foster" "<p><img alt=\"bomberjam.png\" src=\"http://indiegames.com/bomberjam.png\" width=\"480\" height=\"350\" class=\"mt-image-center\" style=\"text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;\" /><a href=\"http://indiegames.com/2012/08/freeware_game_pick_telepaint_m.html\">Telepaint</a> developer Mark Foster's 'territory annihilation game' <a href=\"http://iamclaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/bomberjam1.swf\">Bomberjam</a> is a local, two-player only battle where players use bombs to destroy the opponent's land and eventually the opponent itself.

Having the opportunity to dig into tools like Maya and Microsoft Visual Studio and pushing to use them in new ways was valuable. Fluency with the core tools helped make the world richer in the game's journey from prototype to full game.</p><p>\"Knowing how the tools work... allows you to pivot and solve the problems that come up,\" he says. \"That's where you get into the really interesting territory.\"</p><p>Designing for any kind of larger games means you end up spending most of your time debugging, at least on the programming side. \"You spend a lot of time just tuning, and figuring out how to make things just slightly better, and being really fluent in the tools gives you a better insight into how they work... the more you know, the better.\"</p><p>Being exposed to miscellaneous tools that aren't core to his daily work also helped Dallas. USC sees much cross-pollination between the cinema team and the ineractive entertainment team in terms of understanding and sharing practices for resources like AfterEffects and ProTools. Familiarity with these ended up being \"really valuable.\"</p><p>\"Instead of writing a dock for the animators, I could make... a really crappy thing, but it actually moved around, and it was much more helpful,\" Dallas says of <i>Unfinished Swan</i>'s animated story portions. </p><p>He also learned the importance of negotiation, and suggests strongly identifying what elements are most valuable to you as a developer versus what elements add the most value for the publisher can help with the give-and-take of those deals.</p><p>And having the peer support from the USC scene mattered, both during the development process and during the equally-beneficial festival circuit. The challenges of showing at festivals can also be learning opportunities: \"The first day on the show floor you have 100 people playing the same tiny section of the game, and they're going to break it!\" Dallas says. </p><p>Being able to edit the game on the show floor is \"empowering,\" and allows developers to test out different audience feedback -- and also eases the stress of having a game crash as new people try it for the first time.</p><p>Once the team began to grow and development of <i>Unfinished Swan</i> as a full-fledged game began, Dallas initially wondered if a producer was even needed -- choosing to have one turned out to be the right decision. \"If you don't have somebody to jump on grenades, nobody's going to get any work done,\" he laughs. </p><p>Frequent playtests are clearly good for design, but are also valuable for giving teams a sense of investment in their work. Everyone is motivated to have things ready to share at the next test playthrough. \"Games are a marathon; it's hard to know three miles into the marathon if you're really on pace. But having weekly playtests is a good gut check for you, to see [how] things are coming together. It gives you some fail points, to fail gently.\" </p><p>He advises keeping task management as simple as possible -- using Google Docs and a spreadsheet was available and frictionless for everyone, versus having complicated workflow software. And a weekly team lunch gives the team an opportunity to get out of the office and to bond, and to see one another as people from various disciplines versus fellow employees.</p><p>\"It's interesting how the process of making a game changes when you [pass] around seven or eight people. That was the point it stopped feeling like a family, and a little more like a company. At seven or eight people is where you start to need another layer of management.\" </p><p>This means huge improvements can come late in development: \"At the end of the project, you're like superheroes... and the biggest factor is that you actually know the game you're making, by that point. And you have better tools that do exactly what you need to do for your game,\" Dallas says.</p><p>[<i>Leigh Alexander wrote this article originally for sister site <a href=\"http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/189261/Lessons_from_The_Unfinished_Swans_unique_development_journey.php\">Gamasutra</a></i>]</p>") (feedburner:origLink nil "http://indiegames.com/2013/04/lessons_from_the_unfinished_sw.html"))))
