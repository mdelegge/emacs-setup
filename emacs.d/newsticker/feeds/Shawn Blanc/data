Later in the year &mdash; some time after our summer vacation to the Colorado mountains &mdash; as I was looking through the photos we had of him, I realized I wasn&#8217;t giddy about hardly any of them.</p><p>There were many great snapshots of some very fond memories. But none of the images were of a quality where I wanted to print them out and frame them. They pretty much only looked good on the small screen of my iPhone.</p><p>That&#8217;s when I decided my iPhone shouldn&#8217;t bear the burden of being the best and only camera in the house.</p><p>I began <a href=\"http://shawnblanc.net/2012/11/hunting-for-the-best-mirrorless-camera/\">researching mirrorless cameras</a> looking for a rig I could easily take with me anywhere I went, and which cost under $1,000. I wanted the camera to have an Auto mode so I could just point and shoot if I wanted to, or so I could hand it to a family member to point and shoot with. But it also needed to have good manual modes so I could learn and grow into the manual controls as I learned more about the technical details of photography.</p><p>The rig I chose was the new <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0096WDMGC/ref=nosim&amp;tag=shabla-20\">Olympus E-PL5</a> and the world-famous <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B002IKLJVE/ref=nosim&amp;tag=shabla-20\">Panasonic 20mm f/1.7</a> pancake lens.</p><p><a href=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/epl5-hero-2.jpg\"><img class=\"leftb\" src=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/epl5-hero-2.jpg\" width=\"460\" title=\"The Olympus E-PL5\" alt=\"The Olympus E-PL5\" /></a></p><p><a href=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/epl5-hero-3.jpg\"><img class=\"leftb\" src=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/epl5-hero-3.jpg\" width=\"460\" title=\"The Olympus E-PL5\" alt=\"The Olympus E-PL5\" /></a></p><p>After 6 months shooting with the E-PL5, I continue to be impressed and pleased by the quality of the images this small and sturdy rig is capable of.</p><p><em>(Note: Click the images to zoom them.)</em></p><p><a href=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/bandbcafe.jpg\"><img class=\"leftb\" src=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/bandbcafe.jpg\" width=\"460\" title=\"The B and B Cafe in Castle Rock, CO\" alt=\"The B and B Cafe in Castle Rock, CO\" /></a></p><p>Though my skill behind the lens still leaves much to be desired, my slow-growing collection of great images has long since proven to me that getting a nice camera was a good idea. The photographs I&#8217;ve taken with the E-PL5 juxtapose themselves against my iPhone pics because the images from the E-PL5 are ones which look <em>better</em> when on a big screen or printed out and framed.</p><p>This isn&#8217;t something exclusive to the E-PL5, of course. Any decent camera with good sensor and quality glass will take some great shots. At $900 &mdash; the price for the E-PL5 body and the Panasonic 20mm f/1.7 lens &mdash; I would be upset if this rig <em>did&#8217;t</em> produce some great images.</p><p><a href=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/noah-christmas.jpg\"><img class=\"leftb\" src=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/noah-christmas.jpg\" width=\"460\" title=\"Noah\" alt=\"Noah\" /></a></p><p><a href=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/anna-portrait.jpg\"><img class=\"leftb\" src=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/anna-portrait.jpg\" width=\"460\" title=\"Anna\" alt=\"Anna\" /></a></p><p><a href=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/siphon-coffee.jpg\"><img class=\"leftb\" src=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/siphon-coffee.jpg\" width=\"460\" title=\"Siphon Coffee\" alt=\"Siphon Coffee\" /></a></p><p>There are a few reasons I went with the E-PL5 instead of the many, many other options out there in the mirrorless category:</p><ul><li>I didn&#8217;t go with the RX-1 because its price tag is 3 times what my budget was.</li><li>I didn&#8217;t go with any of the Sony NEX line because I wanted a better lens selection and smaller camera body.</li><li>I didn&#8217;t go with the Panasonic GX-1 because I could afford a better camera if I could find one.</li></ul><p>In short, the E-PL5 was the smallest camera I could find with the best possible sensor inside and most features.</p><p>As I&#8217;ll talk more about below, this camera is basically the guts of the E-M5 put inside a smaller body with a few less pro features on the outside. And that, my friends, is why I consider the E-PL5 to be one of the best-kept secrets in the Micro Four Thirds category.</p><h4>Aside regarding the King of the M4/3 Hill, the OM-D E-M5</h4><p>I didn&#8217;t want to write a review of the E-PL5 without at least a little bit of context and experience with some of the other offerings out there. So I rented the Olympus <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0074WDDN8/ref=nosim&amp;tag=shabla-20\">OM-D E-M5</a> along with the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0058PL9QG/ref=nosim&amp;tag=shabla-20\">Olympus 45mm f/1.8 lens</a> for a few weeks.</p><p>The E-M5 is widely regarded as the best Micro Four Thirds camera out there.</p><p>When I bought the E-PL5, it was so new to the market that I could hardly find any hands-on reviews. But what made it so special is the fact that its sensor and processor are the same as what is found in the E-M5. Because of all the great reviews I&#8217;d been reading about the E-M5, I felt confident buying the E-PL5 on blind faith, trusting that it would be able to perform admirably.</p><p>I rented the E-M5 to give myself some context for how the E-PL5 compares against the best M4/3 camera out there, and also to find out for sure if I had made the right choice in getting a smaller and cheaper camera with a few less features and controls.</p><p>The most significant differences between the E-M5 and the E-PL5 are the pro-level features the former has which the latter does not. The E-M5 has a built-in electronic viewfinder, two manual dial controls, and a slightly larger hand grip. The E-M5 is also weather proof (meaning you can take it out in the rain without fear of ruining it), while the E-PL5 is not.</p><p>On the inside, the E-M5 and E-PL5 are much more similar. They have the same 16MP sensor and image processor that made the E-M5 so famous. They both have in-body image stabilization (though the E-M5 has 5-axis IBIS, while the E-PL5 uses conventional 2-axis), and they both have a dust reduction system that silently vibrates the sensor each time you turn on the camera to help &#8220;fling&#8221; any dust which may be there.</p><p>In my usage and comparisons, the two cameras produced nearly identical images. In several situations I took images with both the E-M5 and E-PL5, even switching lenses so as to try and take the exact same image with both cameras. To my eye, the shots look like they&#8217;re from the same camera.</p><p><em>Below: taken with the E-M5 and 45mm lens, 1/100sec at f/1.8, ISO 500</em><a href=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/noah-em5.jpg\"><img class=\"leftb\" src=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/noah-em5.jpg\" height=\" \" width=\"460\" title=\"Taken with E-M5 and 45mm lens\" alt=\"Taken with E-M5 and 45mm lens\" /></a></p><p><em>Below: taken with the E-PL5 and 45mm, 1/80sec at f/1.8, ISO 400</em><a href=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/noah-epl5-comparison.jpg\"><img class=\"leftb\" src=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/noah-epl5-comparison.jpg\" height=\" \" width=\"460\" title=\"Taken with the E-PL5 and 45mm lens\" alt=\"Taken with the E-PL5 and 45mm lens\" /></a></p><p><em>Below: taken with the E-M5 and 20mm, 1/60sec at f/1.7, ISO 400</em><a href=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/typewriter-em5.jpg\"><img class=\"leftb\" src=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/typewriter-em5.jpg\" height=\" \" width=\"460\" title=\"taken with the E-M5 and 20mm\" alt=\"taken with the E-M5 and 20mm\" /></a></p><p><em>Below: taken with the E-PL5 and 20mm, 1/50sec at f/1.7, ISO 400</em><a href=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/typewriter-epl5.jpg\"><img class=\"leftb\" src=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/typewriter-epl5.jpg\" height=\" \" width=\"460\" title=\"taken with the E-PL5 and 20mm lens\" alt=\"taken with the E-PL5 and 20mm lens\" /></a></p><p>In my opinion, the advantages of the E-M5 over the E-PL5 are almost entirely in the bells and whistles and not in the end-product capabilities. For photographers who have used bigger DSLR rigs, or who really want a viewfinder, then the E-M5 will probably feel more comfortable. But for everyone else, the $400 you&#8217;ll save by buying the E-PL5 instead of the E-M5 is probably better spent on a nice lens.</p><h3>E-PL5 Overview</h3><p>With the Panasonic pancake lens attached, the E-PL5 is small enough to fit in my coat pocket, the glove box in my Jeep, or alongside my MacBook Air, iPad, and Moleskine inside my extra small Timbuk2 bag.</p><p>The build quality is excellent. The camera is sturdy but not heavy, weighing just 1 pound with the 20mm pancake lens and wrist strap attached (body only, the E-PL5 weighs a mere 12 ounces). And because of its smaller size and lack of a viewfinder, the E-PL5 doesn&#8217;t look too intimidating.</p><p>The humble appearance of the E-PL5 is one of its best features. With it I feel less like a &#8220;wannabe pro photographer&#8221; and more like a &#8220;casual photography enthusiast&#8221; when I have the camera out in public.</p><p>My goal with the E-PL5 wasn&#8217;t to get my toe in the waters of professional photography. I just wanted a high-quality camera nearby for when I would have otherwise reached for my iPhone.</p><p>Having a non-giant camera makes it far more likely that I will take it with me when I&#8217;m leaving the house and to actually use it while I&#8217;m out. Coat-pocketable means &#8220;it will get used&#8221; in this case. And isn&#8217;t that the whole point?</p><h4>Sans Viewfinder</h4><p>The E-PL5 does not have a built-in electronic viewfinder (EVF) &mdash; to frame your shots, you use the view screen.</p><p>For some people, this may be a deal breaker. What&#8217;s nice about having a viewfinder is that you can <a href=\"http://hypertext.net/2013/02/davidson-rx1\">hide behind it</a>, and also you can steady your camera a bit better by holding it up to your face. But in my few weeks with the E-M5 (which does have a viewfinder), I found myself using the E-M5&#8242;s view screen instead of its built-in EVF.</p><p>For me, sacrificing a viewfinder is worth the tradeoff because it means having a smaller camera body. However, since the E-PL5 supports add-ons via its hotshoe connection, you could buy the Olympus <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B003A4GZUC/ref=nosim&amp;tag=shabla-20\">VF2</a> or <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B005FQSXFI/ref=nosim&amp;tag=shabla-20\">VF3</a>.</p><h4>The View Screen</h4><p>On the back of the camera is a 3-inch, tilting, LCD touch screen.</p><p>You can tap to focus, tap to adjust color settings, and more. There is a dial control &#8220;d-pad&#8221; placed just to the right of the screen which also evokes the menu and is used to navigate through all the levels of settings.</p><p>The screen isn&#8217;t stationary either &mdash; it flips out and can tilt.</p><p><a href=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/epl5-flip-out-view-screen.jpg\"><img class=\"leftb\" src=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/epl5-flip-out-view-screen.jpg\" width=\"460\" title=\"The Flip-out view screen on the E-PL5\" alt=\"The Flip-out view screen on the E-PL5\" /></a></p><p>I was worried about the fragility of the flip-out screen. But to my relief, the hinges are incredibly sturdy and well built. I am often taking shots with the camera held down near my waist, and it&#8217;s easy to just flip the screen up 90 degrees and look down into the view screen. In short, it moves easily, holds in place just fine, and is a considerably useful feature.</p><p>The quality of the display itself is excellent as well. Though Olympus does not say what the actual screen resolution is, they do say it&#8217;s a 3-inch diagonal screen with a 16:9 aspect of approximately 460,000 dots. If &#8220;dots&#8221; means &#8220;pixels,&#8221; then the view screen would have a resolution somewhere in the neighborhood of 904&#215;507 pixels with a PPI density of 345. Now, the view screen is certainly nice, but it&#8217;s not <em>that</em> nice.</p><p>On Twitter, Milosz Bolechowski <a href=\"https://twitter.com/meewosh/status/319200781247082496\">pointed out</a> that the &#8220;dots&#8221; are likely <a href=\"https://twitter.com/meewosh/status/319201065683779584\">referring to</a> each of the 3 RBG dots in a single pixel. Which I agree is most likely the case. Meaning the 460,000 or so dots in the view screen equal approximately 153,333 pixels.</p><p>Thus, the view screen most likely has a resolution of 533&#215;294 with a PPI density of 200.</p><p>To protect the screen, I bought one of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B003U2YCZE/ref=nosim&amp;tag=shabla-20\">these plastic screen covers</a>. It&#8217;s sized for the NEX cameras, but it&#8217;s a near-perfect fit for the E-PL5 as well &mdash; I never even notice that it&#8217;s there. Highly recommended.</p><h4>The Grip</h4><p>The E-PL5 comes with a small, removable hand grip. Without the grip attached, the camera has a bit more of a classic look to it, akin to the thin and simple rangefinder bodies of old.</p><p>But I can&#8217;t imagine <em>not</em> wanting to attach the grip. It adds hardly any size and makes the E-PL5 significantly easier to hold with one hand. When attached, the grip stays quite secure, as if it were built in as part of the camera body from the start.</p><h4>Manual Dials and Shooting in Manual Mode</h4><p>As expected, the E-PL5 has several different shooting modes: Auto, Program, Aperture-Priority, Shutter-Priority, and Manual. As well as Movie, Scene, and Art modes.</p><p>I mostly shoot in Aperture-Priority mode and am happy to let the camera pick the shutter speed for me in order to get the right exposure.</p><p>The Movie and Art modes allow you to choose an artsy filter to apply to your movie or photograph &mdash; it&#8217;s like having Instagram built in to your camera. I&#8217;ve never used these in real life (I prefer to edit my images in <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/adobe-photoshop-lightroom-4/id506734677?mt=12&amp;partnerId=30&amp;siteID=jVL634u150Y\">Lightroom 4</a>), but here are two sample shots I took for this review: one using the <a href=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/root-beer-pin-hole.jpg\">Pin Hole</a> filter and one using the <a href=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/root-beer-grainy-film.jpg\">Grainy Film</a> filter. Both of these shots are the out of camera JPGs, but the E-PL5&#8242;s in-camera filters are applied to the RAW image file as well, so I could take remove them in Lightroom if I wanted.</p><p>What I most wish the E-PL5 had was a few dedicated manual dial controls. When shooting in Aperture-Priority Mode, Manual, or the like, having a few dials that give you quick and instant access to adjust the aperture, shutter, and/or ISO are very nice. The E-M5 had these dials and I found myself using them all the time.</p><p>On the E-PL5, when I&#8217;m shooting in Aperture-Priority mode (which is the most common setting for me), adjusting the aperture number requires a tap &#8220;up&#8221; on the menu D-Pad to highlight the aperture setting, and then a tap left or right in order to increase or decrease the aperture. Moreover, the D-Pad is pretty small (smaller than a Dime) and therefore is not easy to navigate. This is not nearly as nice or fast as having a dial that you can click left or right without having to lean back and look at the camera for a few seconds.</p><h4>Battery Life</h4><p>Battery life is absolutely fantastic. On the very first charge, after 4 days of shooting and about 500 images, it was low on battery. After that first charge I didn&#8217;t need to charge the battery for over 2.5 weeks, and that was with near daily use.</p><p>The camera seems to go forever. The battery is one thing I&#8217;ve never once worried about, nor have I been out shooting and had the battery die on me. If I know I&#8217;ll be using the camera a lot over the weekend or something then I&#8217;ll charge it up ahead of time.</p><p>The only thing I don&#8217;t like about the battery is that it comes with its own charging station. This means when traveling there is one more cable and trinket to pack. I&#8217;d prefer to be able to charge the battery by plugging a USB cable into the camera itself.</p><h4>Low-Light Performance</h4><p>For what I know about low light performance, the E-PL5 performs wonderfully. Low-light images have very little noise, and can generally be doctored just fine in Lightroom.</p><p>With the default white balance settings, I&#8217;ve noticed that images straight out of the camera tend to have a bit of a warm tone to them, giving portraits a bit more orange-colored skin tone than is to my liking. This can be adjusted in the camera&#8217;s white balance settings to have a more &#8220;cool&#8221; tint to them, or the orange skin can be easily fixed in Lightroom.</p><p>The biggest downside of low light shooting is not the image quality, but the autofocus. The 20mm lens already has a tendency to hunt at times, and in low light situations you can sometimes wait 2 or 3 seconds for the autofocus to find a contrast point and snap the image.</p><p>There have only been a few low-light situations where the lighting was so dark that I was frustrated with the E-PL5&#8242;s ability to focus and snap a shot. One of those times was when we all went out to dinner for my dad&#8217;s 60th birthday. We were at a fancy steak restaurant where the lighting was extremely dim.</p><p>The E-PL5 comes with a flash that attaches via the hotshoe port on top, but I&#8217;ve never used it. In a setting like the steak restaurant, using the flash would have been rude; in most other settings the flash isn&#8217;t even necessary.</p><p>For most low-light settings (such as indoors in the evening), the camera does great with very little noise in the images.</p><h4>Speed</h4><ul><li><p><strong>Startup speed:</strong> From the time I press the power button to when the camera is ready to snap a picture, it&#8217;s less than 2 seconds.</p><p>The E-PL5 is usually up and ready to go before I even have the lens cap off. Which means if the Olympus is nearby, it&#8217;s actually faster for me to grab it, turn it on, and snap a shot than it is for me to pull my iPhone out of my pocket and launch the Camera app. Even when racing against the Lock Screen Camera app shortcut, the E-PL5 wins by about 1 second.</p></li><li><p><strong>Shot-to-shot speed:</strong> If you want to manually shoot several shots in succession, in decent indoor light or better, the the E-PL5 takes just 1.5 seconds to autofocus, snap a picture, write to the card, and then be ready to focus again.</p></li><li><p><strong>Autofocus speed:</strong> The Olympus is well known for its fast autofocus. As I mention below in the section on lenses, the autofocus on the Olympus 45mm lens is so fast it seems instantaneous; with the Panasonic 20mm the autofocus is a bit slower.</p><p>You can hold the shutter button halfway down to have the camera autofocus on either an area within the viewfinder grid, or the camera can automatically find a face and focus on the nearest eyeball. Then, pressing the shutter button all the way down snaps the image. But, if you want the camera to snap a photo as soon as it&#8217;s grabbed focus, you can press the shutter button all the way down right away and it will snap as soon as it has focus. In decent light, this is almost instantaneously.</p><p>Moreover, you can focus and shoot an image using the touchscreen. You can set the camera to tap to focus on any area of the screen, but you can also configure it to snap the shot as soon as it locks the focus.</p><p>Using the E-PL5&#8242;s touchscreen reminds me a lot of using the camera on my iPhone. The camera&#8217;s software is responsive, clever, and useful. Well done, Olympus.</p></li></ul><h4>Camera Straps</h4><p>The stock camera strap is lame. It&#8217;s not detachable, nor is it long enough to let the camera rest at a comfortable distance when over one shoulder and under my other arm.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.dsptch.com\">DSPTCH</a> makes some pretty awesome shoulder straps. I ordered one from them that I really like, but after a couple months of use I felt like I didn&#8217;t always want a shoulder strap attached. In fact, I often don&#8217;t &mdash; most of the time the camera is in my bag or in my jacket pocket and I&#8217;m not walking around with it around my shoulder. (Of course, now that summer is approaching, that may change.)</p><p>So I ordered yet another strap. This time a <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/shawnblanc/8576113368/\">small leather wrist strap</a> from <a href=\"http://www.gordyscamerastraps.com\">Gordy&#8217;s</a>. The wrist strap is small enough to not be in the way when just grabbing the camera, and I think it looks great.</p><p>I probably should have ordered one of DSPTCH&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.dsptch.com/collections/wrist\">wrist straps</a> which use the same clip that their shoulder straps use. This would have made it easy for me to swap out the shoulder strap and the wrist strap depending on my need. But the leather straps at Gordy&#8217;s were too cool to pass by. <em>Whatchagonnado?</em></p><p><a href=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/gordy-camera-strap.jpg\"><img class=\"leftb\" src=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/gordy-camera-strap.jpg\" width=\"460\" title=\"One of Gordy's Camera Straps\" alt=\"One of Gordy's leather camera straps\" /></a></p><h3>Lenses</h3><p>A Micro Four Thirds sensor has a crop ratio of 1/2. So, for example, a 20mm lens on a M4/3 rig is actually a 40mm equivalent when compared to a full-frame sensor. Which is why shooting with the 20mm as my daily glass is not as fishy as it sounds, because it&#8217;s just a bit bigger than shooting with a good ole 35mm lens.</p><p>I&#8217;ve used 3 of the most popular Micro Four Thirds lenses:</p><ul><li><p><strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B002IKLJVE/ref=nosim&amp;tag=shabla-20\">Panasonic 20/1.7 lens:</a></strong> This is the lens attached to my rig. Though this lens is certainly no slouch, perhaps it&#8217;s greatest advantage compared to the lenses below is its size. The pancake lens looks great on the small body of the E-PL5 and affords the rig to easily fit in coat pockets, etc.</p><p>The disadvantages of the 20mm is that because of its compact size it doesn&#8217;t grab quite as high-quality images as a &#8220;regular sized&#8221; lens. But, at least to my eyes, the difference is barely noticeable and the advantages in both size and cost far outweigh the very slight disadvantages in image quality.</p><p>Unless you know that you want a different lens, this is the one I would start with.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0055N2L22/ref=nosim&amp;tag=shabla-20\">Panasonic 25/1.4 lens:</a></strong> Compared to the 20mm pancake, this 25mm produces higher quality images, has faster autofocus, and is capable of a better and creamier depth of field. But it&#8217;s also a larger piece of glass and it costs $150 more (so, obviously it had better take better images).</p><p>Though this is my favorite lens of the 3 I&#8217;ve tried, the size turned me off to the 25mm as my daily glass &mdash; it is too big to allow the camera to easily fit in my coat pocket. And the focal length is too similar to the 20mm to justify owning both lenses (as much as I would love to own them both). So I returned the 25mm and kept the 20mm.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0058PL9QG/ref=nosim&amp;tag=shabla-20\">Olympus 45/1.8 lens:</a></strong> This is the portrait lens of the Micro Four Thirds world. One thing Olympus lenses are known for is their lightning-fast auto focusing, and it&#8217;s true. This lens hunts far less than the 20mm, and its images are so clear and crisp.</p><p>If and when I decide to buy a second lens, it will likely be the 45mm. Compared to the 20mm pancake, the 45mm is not nearly as compact or attractive (seriously, a silver lens on a black body?). If the 45mm were my only lens, I know I&#8217;d be using the E-PL5 less often.</p></li></ul><h3>Editing Workflow</h3><p>So far my editing workflow is simple and straightforward. I plug my camera&#8217;s SD card into my MacBook Air, import the photos into Lightroom 4, and then make some minor edits using one of VSCO&#8217;s Film packs.</p><p>During <a href=\"http://5by5.tv/bb/85\">one of our B&amp;B shows</a>, my pal Ben Brooks told me how he uses a 0-based rating system which I&#8217;ve also adopted. When going through the latest lot of imported photos, I flag all the blurry, crappy, or duplicate images for deletion. Then I go through and rate what I think are the best photos with a 3-, 4-, or 5-star rating.</p><p>I then upload my favorites to <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/shawnblanc/\">my Flickr account</a>. We&#8217;ve had a few printed and framed so far, and I think it&#8217;s just great to have my own pictures of my own family up and around in my home. Printing through <a href=\"http://www.shutterfly.com\">Shutterfly</a> is cheap and easy enough that with a few easy-swap frames, we can change out our 8&#215;10 prints pretty much as often as we like.</p><p>Perhaps a more-detailed writeup on this subject is in order because there are a few things about my editing workflow that I&#8217;m still not happy with. Primarily:</p><ul><li>Archiving old images &mdash; right now they&#8217;re all on my MacBook Air and quickly encroaching on my disk space.</li><li>Posting my favorite images &mdash; while Flickr is nice, I&#8217;d like a spot that&#8217;s a little bit more my own. I&#8217;ve been considering setting up my own image portfolio website just so I can have a spot that encourages more regular posting of images. </li></ul><h3>Real-Life Usage</h3><p>One of the most rewarding parts of photography is when, after a lot of shooting, I plug the card into my MacBook Air, import all the most-recent photos, and begin to look them over. If there are 1 or 2 (or even 3) shots that turned out awesome, then all the energy that went into capturing those few photographs was worth it.</p><p>When I find those few great images from the batch, I lean back in my chair. Looking at one of them, I take a deep breath and smile. Then I call my wife to come downstairs and check out the latest photos, and we talk about what it is that we like about it. Maybe it&#8217;s an image of our son, Noah, that captured one of his many funny faces. Maybe it&#8217;s a shot that&#8217;s framed just right, or has light that&#8217;s doing some incredible thing.</p><p>I&#8217;m still learning, and so right now maybe 1 in 500 shots turn out that good. But when they do, I love it that the quality can be there to match the times when the composition is just right. When I compare moments like that with the times I&#8217;ve gone through my iPhone&#8217;s photo library, though I have lots of pictures, they are all more like snapshots and not photographs (if that makes sense).</p><p>Shots like this are the rare ones which justify my camera purchase a hundred times over.</p><p><a href=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/anna-noah-reading.jpg\"><img class=\"leftb\" src=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/anna-noah-reading.jpg\" width=\"460\" title=\"Anna and Noah reading\" alt=\"Anna and Noah reading\" /></a></p><p>Images like these are, of course, not going to be exclusive to the E-PL5. There are many other amazing cameras out there. For me, going with a small rig instead of a large DSLR (or even a medium-sized NEX) means I&#8217;m much more likely to actually take the camera with me.</p><p>And that is the entire point: The E-PL5 is an extremely capable and delightfully portable camera.</p>

Vdio is more like iTunes in that you buy or rent each movie or TV show. I&#8217;m curious why Vdio went with the iTunes-type of access model as opposed to the Netflix-esque access model that Rdio uses.</p><p>It&#8217;s probably that they couldn&#8217;t.</p><p>At the top of Vdio&#8217;s movie list are all the latest Academy Award nominated films, new releases, and many others. Pretty much all the same films sitting on the iTunes home page right now. None of those films are available on Netflix.</p><p>I would say that some sort of amalgamation of the two access models would be great: Paying Vdio a monthly fee to get unlimited access to whatever movies and TV shows that they are able to negotiate with studios, and then the ones which are not available that way you can pay extra to buy or rent.</p><p>But then I realize I already have that exact service via Netflix, iTunes, and my Apple TV.</p><p>As far as I can see, the only leg up Rdio has over Netflix and iTunes is their social network. As they wrote on their announcement post, some of the advantages to Vdio are the social-esque features such as seeing what your friends are watching, and creating &#8220;sets&#8221; (a.k.a. playlists for TV shows and movies) that you can then share with people.</p><p>Vdio has an iPad app, but it can do nothing but play movies you&#8217;ve purchased or rented through the Vdio website. You cannot browse Vdio on the iPad app. The app does support AirPlay, so you can play the video on your television via your Apple TV.</p><p>But if you&#8217;ve got an Apple TV, what&#8217;s the advantage of using Vdio over iTunes? The prices are the same, the selection is smaller, and the experience is limited.</p><p>If you&#8217;re an Rdio unlimited subscriber in the US or UK then you can log in to Vdio now, and they&#8217;ve given us each a $25 credit to use for buying or renting.</p><p>When Rdio first launched I wasn&#8217;t keen on it, but I have since become <a href=\"http://shawnblanc.net/2012/11/rdio-killed-itunes/\">a huge fan of the music service</a>. So perhaps it&#8217;s fitting that I am not currently excited about Vdio. As the service and app stand now, I suspect the $25 they gave me will be the only money I spend there. But you know what? At least they&#8217;re building something.</p><p><a href=\"http://shawnblanc.net/2013/04/rdio-introduces-vdio/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent link to 'Rdio Introduces Vdio'\" class=\"glyph\">✚</a></p>

The first hard drive bay with the operation system is a 160GB SSD from Intel, the other three bays carry bigger regular hard disks.</p><p>I&#8217;m a die-hard fan of the wired Apple aluminum keyboard. This particular one is the English version, more specific: the international one with a larger return key and some other minor differences. Oddly enough it isn&#8217;t listed in the Apple Store anymore. Furthermore I also own a Magic Trackpad which is placed to the right of the keyboard along with a Magic Mouse. I switch frequently between the mouse and the trackpad. If I feel that my wrist is overstrained I throw my mouse into the drawer for the rest of the day and use the trackpad. Apart from this being my regular setup, sometimes I put the trackpad on the left side of the keyboard just to scroll through documents and use my left hand a bit more.</p><p><img class=\"leftb\" src=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/patrick-welker-portables.jpg\" width=\"460\" title=\"Patrick Welker Portables\" alt=\"Patrick Welker Portables\" /></p><p>My secondary Mac is an 11-inch MacBook Air (1.6 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo, 4GB RAM) which I tend to neglect when I&#8217;m at home and not working on the Mac Pro. My 32GB third-generation iPad is now the undisputed champion of the living room and gives the MacBook a hard time finding the attention it deserves. When my iPad is resting it sits on the <a href=\"http://www.twelvesouth.com/products/compass/\">Compass</a> stand from Twelve South. The daring position of the Compass is on the left edge of my desk… and so far my iPad took the plunge &#8220;only&#8221; once. Terrible, I know.</p><p>The following are my additional gadgets for the iPad: (my girlfriend&#8217;s) <a href=\"http://the-maglus.myshopify.com/\">Maglus Stylus</a>, an old $5 pogo stylus, a black leather Smart Cover, a <a href=\"http://www.toddygear.com/shop/Toddy-Smart-Cloth/5x7/HauteToddy/Havana\">Havana smart cloth</a> from Toddy Gear and a <a href=\"http://tabuproducts.com/shop/pouch-2/\">Tabü tablet poüch</a> to give the iPad some extra protection.</p><p>When I&#8217;m on the road I use a messenger bag to carry my MacBook and iPad. I choose to go with the <a href=\"http://www.tombihn.com/laptop_bags/TB0221.html\">Ristretto from Tom Bihn</a> (link to successor) despite the high shipping costs and customs tax that are due when importing something from the United States. The bag is equipped with the fantastic <a href=\"http://www.tombihn.com/accessories/TB0505.html\">Absolute Shoulder Strap</a> and a lot of their nifty pouches and leashes. Ninety percent of the times when I leave the house I travel with my bike, and due to Tom Bihn&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.tombihn.com/accessories/GDF-LIGHT.html\">Guardian Dual Function Light</a> I feel a lot safer when riding in the dark.</p><p>In case I&#8217;m not on one of the above mentioned devices my right hand becomes unusable for common tasks. You might think this is because I&#8217;m such a reasonable person and finally give my hand some rest, let it calm down after the heavy duty mouse and keyboard work it endured. Far from it! It&#8217;s unusable because it automatically grabs my 32GB iPhone and merges with it. I have the theory that this is a widespread disease. By the way, my phone is wrapped in a <a href=\"http://twelvesouth.com/products/bookbook_iphone5/\">BookBook case</a>. Despite the fact that I love the look and feel of a naked iPhone (after all it&#8217;s a beautiful device), for me the sheer practicality of the case justifies adding a bit of bulk.</p><p><img class=\"leftb\" src=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/patrick-welker-audio.jpg\" width=\"460\" title=\"Patrick Welker Audio Gear\" alt=\"Patrick Welker Audio Gear\" /></p><p>Now we come to the relicts of my activity as a producer. First there are my beloved <a href=\"http://dynaudioprofessional.com/bm-series/monitors/bm5a-mkii/\">Dynaudio BM5A</a> studio monitors (&#8220;monitors&#8221; is the term used by audio engineers to refer to their speakers, and, by the way, the link points to the successor). Secondly, my current Mic setup consists of an <a href=\"http://www.akg.com/site/products/powerslave,id,219,pid,219,nodeid,2,_language,EN.html\">AKG C 4000 B Studio</a> (a condenser microphone) and the <a href=\"http://www.shure.com/americas/products/microphones/sm/sm58-vocal-microphone\">Shure SM58</a> (a dynamic microphone).</p><p>Next, my midi-controller is a Novation ReMOTE 37SL and the audio interface of my choice is a <a href=\"http://www.rme-audio.de/en_products_fireface_400.php\">RME Fireface 400</a>. Finally, the last part of my audio gear are three headphones: a Philips SHP8900 for listening, an <a href=\"http://www.akg.com/site/products/powerslave,id,252,pid,252,nodeid,2,_language,EN.html\">AKG K240 Studio</a> as my personal reference monitor and a <a href=\"http://en-us.sennheiser.com/wireless-bluetooth-headset-stereo-mm-550-x-travel\">Sennheiser MM 550 Travel</a> (link to successor).</p><p>Lastly, there is just enough room for one more gadget on the desk: my old Wacom Intuos 3 (6&#215;8).</p><p><img class=\"leftb\" src=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/patrick-welker-below.jpg\" width=\"460\" alt=\"Below the desk\" /></p><p>On the lower surface of my desktop is a <a href=\"http://www.exsys.ch/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=210&amp;language=en&amp;zenid=b3cd9a33f27d7d5cd4c985e1937ed543\">EXSYS EX-1177</a> USB 2.0 HUB with 7 ports. It is connected to my equinux TubeStick and all things USB. I label all cables going into the hub by writing the name of the gadget with a felt marker on a piece of crepe tape.</p><p>Beside my Mac a drawer unit is also placed under my desk. In the first drawer are pens and chargers to my various gadgets. Additionally, to have my Tom Bihn pouches close at hand the second drawer is solely reserved to them. On top of the drawer is a <a href=\"http://brennenstuhl.de/content.php?Produkte%2FPower+Distribution%2FSurge+Protection%2FPower+Manager+PMA+USB+15.000+A&amp;seite=shop/produkte.php&amp;hauptrubrik=481&amp;details=10269\">power manager from Brennenstuhl</a> with one main switch and 6 separate switches to selectively toggle my equipment on and off. My cable modem, WLAN router and an 
<a href=\"http://www.icydock.com/goods.php?id=33\">ICY DOCK ICYCube</a> sit on top of the power manager.</p><p><img class=\"leftb\" src=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/patrick-welker-atmo1.jpg\" width=\"460\" title=\"Health Appliances\" alt=\"Health Appliances\" /></p><p><img class=\"leftb\" src=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/patrick-welker-atmo2.jpg\" width=\"460\" title=\"Health Appliances\" alt=\"Health Appliances\" /></p><p>The last part of my setup is what I call my health appliances. Strictly speaking they don&#8217;t belong to the setup, but I regard them as important components of my work, that&#8217;s why I decided to include them here.</p><p>When you live and work all day long within a tight space and share it with another person, my belief is that the room you choose needs to have a feel good atmosphere. Moreover, if it is a home office you have the permission to go nuts. To conclude, for me this means transforming my workspace into a whimsical little world with a touch of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawaii\">kawaii</a>.</p><p>On the wall in front of me is an empty yellow picture frame to which I added a red curtain with a floral pattern on the upper side and a wooden shelf on the bottom. On this shelf is the DVD, the excellent soundtrack and a cinema ticket from one of my favorite movies. Since there is still some space left to fill with cuteness, I put a few anime figures (i.a. from Azumanga Daioh) and a plant. The lower surface of the shelf is covered with artificial turf and little flowers (the latter are hard to spot on the photo).</p><p>Below this frame is my illuminated &#8220;cave&#8221;. A Philips Living Colors lamp was one of the best investments I made so far for my workspace. It might sound stupid to say this about a lamp, but it really increased my quality of life &mdash; it literally brightens my day. No wonder they call it a <em>mood light</em>.</p><p>The surface of the cave (again) consists of artificial turf and there&#8217;s a <a href=\"http://www.usa.philips.com/c/Moodlighting/livingcolors-glossy-white-691503148/prd/en/\">Living Colors Mini</a> on the side of it. On the turf my MacBook rests and charges along with a <a href=\"http://www.frankkozik.net/store\">Stache Labbit from Frank Kozik</a>, another plush rabbit my girlfriend made for me, a branch, a raccoon figure, <a href=\"http://store.iconfactory.com/#ollievinyl\">Ollie</a> and lastly a plush carrot and a marzipan carrot for the rabbits because they always look hungry.</p><p>To the left of my desk is a window bench where a little bowl with an forrest inside of it and some animals is placed. I grew up on the countryside and miss mother nature from time to time, so my girlfriend did some handicraft work and made me this present.</p><p>Other health related gadgets:</p><ul><li>My <em>relatively okay</em><a href=\"http://www.tchibo.de/Schreibtischstuhl-p400030422.html?cs=1&amp;vt=a1d8c71586d0e3af213e9eeb360fd91aa9a8b0fb\">office chair</a> is from Tchibo, a German coffee company which apparently also sells a of lot other things.</li><li>A <a href=\"http://www.thera-band.com/store/products.php?ProductID=21\">Thera-Band Hand Exerciser</a> with an egg shape to fight my arthritis.</li><li>A <a href=\"http://power-bar.co.uk/\">Powerbar 2</a> which I use every time I feel drained.</li><li>An <a href=\"http://www.aquaselect.de/en/wasserfilter_glas.php\">Aqua Select Water Filter</a> because I drink about 1.1 gal (4,2 liters) a day.</li><li>Some plush animals who occasionally visit the office. Yeah, I&#8217;m about to turn 32. So what? I&#8217;m a child at heart.</li></ul><p>The last piece of equipment on my list is our printer-scanner-fax Swiss army knife &mdash; a <a href=\"http://www.samsung.com/au/consumer/print-solutions/print-multifunctions-copiers/archive/CLX-3185FW/XSA\">Samsung CLX-3185FW</a> &mdash; which is located in the storeroom. It barely gets used since I work pretty much paperless.</p><h4>3. Why this rig?</h4><p>Here&#8217;s the short story of how I came across my gear.</p><p><strong>The Big Mac</strong></p><p>I bought the Mac Pro for two reasons. The first reason is that my Power Mac G5 was one of the loudest computers I ever owned. It was terribly nerve-racking for me and all of the smaller audio samples I recorded had the Mac&#8217;s omnipresent background noise as <em>a feature</em>. I even bought a soundproof cabinet to tackle that problem. The second reason was that the Mac Pro can take up to four hard drives. I needed a lot of space for storing my audio material and USB or FireWire 800 wasn&#8217;t an option for me at that time. The CPU power and the amount of RAM were also pretty helpful when running multiple instances of a demanding plugin in Pro Tools, Ableton Live, and Logic Pro.</p><p>However, now my daily work is writing, reading, coding and designing. I don&#8217;t necessarily need a Mac Pro for this kind of work, but since the machine is already here and is still an excellent computer, I see no real need to replace it anytime soon (except if Apple decides to stop supporting it when they release the next version of OS X).</p><p><strong>Peripheral Computer Devices</strong></p><p>I use an English keyboard because it&#8217;s part of my &#8220;all-in&#8221; language learning strategy. Despite German being my native language I write down everything in English. Besides that, I also wanted to try if the keyboard layout is a better fit for writing code, and so far I&#8217;m more than happy that I took the plunge. Although it took quite a while to reroute some hard-wired movements to their specific new counterparts on the keyboard. Another thing I have to admit was, that at first I was a tad bummed out since I accidentally bought the international version on eBay. But, I soon realized it was a fitting choice because thereby I gain consistency over all my Macs: for the MacBook I just had to order some keyboard stickers and henceforth all the keys are in the same place again. This wouldn&#8217;t have been possible otherwise.</p><p>The second monitor was an <em>heirloom</em> from my father who moved on to an iMac. I was quite happy with one 24-inch screen, but having two displays opened up a whole new world for me. The result is that I&#8217;m now really lazy when it comes to managing windows on the Mac.</p><p>The ICYCube has room for 4 hard drives just like the Mac Pro. I searched for a simple multi-bay enclosure and tried quite a few. Since I didn&#8217;t need a fancy RAID setup and all I wanted was to slide in the hard disks I already own. This piece of equipment met my criteria perfectly, if I exchange an HD on my Mac Pro I buy a new drive tray for the ICYCube and gain another backup drive. Indeed the enclosure works as my backup solution. At the same time it&#8217;s the place where I have stored all my unedited home video recordings which I might not come to edit in a lifetime since I pay way to much attention to details (also I&#8217;m not very fast when it comes to editing videos). The downside of the enclosure: it&#8217;s pretty loud if you don&#8217;t remove the fan. Then again I only fire it up once a week to copy over the backups from my Macs.</p><p>Let&#8217;s talk USB for a second. I&#8217;ve had trouble with Apple Computers and their USB ports for my whole Apple life (since 2005). I&#8217;ve always had a lot of audio equipment connected to my Mac via USB. The Mac&#8217;s power supply unit could never satisfy the energy-hungry battalion it was faced with. Even on my 2009 Mac Pro the USB ports began to fail until out of six ports only 3 working ones remained. The best investment I&#8217;ve made is an industry USB hub &mdash; it&#8217;s the one and only hub that I tried which delivered enough power (and I tried quite a few). The hub I use is from a swiss company, EXSYS. They offer excellent products in this segment of modern technology. My hub has 4.5 A which is more than enough. Every port gets up to 500 mA. All my devices work properly for the first time.</p><p>Regarding the Wacom tablet I have to admit that I neglect it carelessly. My girlfriend borrowed it over the last few years and it just has returned into my possession since she bought herself a Cintiq for Christmas. I have nothing else to add to my defense.</p><p><strong>The Little Apples</strong></p><p>I ride my bike a lot during the week. Be it my route to the University, or, more rarely, visiting a client. If you have carried a laptop before you know that you feel every ounce of it after a few blocks. The 12-inch PowerBook was my favorite portable computer, but the tiny 11-inch MacBook Air is like a dream come true and it instantly pushed the PowerBook off the throne. It&#8217;s so small, slim and light that I can take it with me everywhere I go, and in addition I don&#8217;t feel like I&#8217;m carrying any additional weight. It is amazing that this is not a toy but a full-fledged system for web development and graphic design work. Also, I still prefer it over the iPad when I&#8217;m on the go and want to write something. Using an iPad at the University isn&#8217;t an option for me because I need to switch between a (digital) book, references and notes all the time. Having two windows open in split view is a great help and the full-sized keyboard is ideal for lectures where I take a lot of notes. Being able to watch and listen while writing down everything in a blind flight over the keyboard is not possible with an iPad (at least not without an external keyboard).</p><p>I still take my iPad with me to University on days where I know I don&#8217;t need to write down a lot of information. On those days the MacBook is allowed to stay at home. However, where the iPad shines in my opinion is when working with clients. I prefer to take my iPad with me to them rather than the MacBook because it&#8217;s nice to pass it on to people. They instantly know how to use it and get a better feel for how the product they&#8217;ve ordered will look and work like.</p><p>Since the retina iPhone was released in June 2010 I knew that Apple would come up with an iPad featuring a similar display. So I decided to wait because I don&#8217;t wanted to use a phone or tablet on a daily basis which lacks such a stellar display. In March 2012 the wait was over. I couldn&#8217;t afford it at that point in time, but finally managed to buy one… shortly before the released the fourth-generation iPad &mdash; didn&#8217;t see that one coming. For me the iPad is the best device for reading and learning in existence. If I find an elaborate tutorial on the internet I usually save it and read it on my iPad.</p><p>Back to the iPad&#8217;s little brother. I bought the iPhone 5 because the iPhone is the device I use most religiously out of all my gadgets. Since Apple changed the form factor &mdash; which they presumably keep for a while &mdash; I felt it was the perfect time to update from my old iPhone 4. I use my phone constantly for all kind of tasks, but here&#8217;s a small list of where it has proven to be most helpful to me:</p><ul><li>snapping a picture</li><li>reading feeds and Instapaper articles</li><li>as a reference book</li><li>as a companion when working out</li><li>relaxing</li><li>communication</li></ul><p>The accessory that is always with my phone is the BookBook case. It is the ideal choice for me since I always forgot my wallet at home. The purchase has paid for itself: I haven&#8217;t had an embarrassing moment at the local grocery store&#8217;s counter since I own the BookBook. Everything important is where I iPhone is. My iPhone is at my side 24/7.</p><p><strong>My Audio Gear</strong></p><p>This is a short one. My current setup is the result of a compromise. At the same time I started my studies at the university I moved in together with my girlfriend into a smaller apartment. My complete rack wouldn&#8217;t have fitted into the new tiny place. I sold almost all my gear to pay the rent for the upcoming months. Since I always had a passion for graphic and Web design and worked as a freelancer in that field while studying as audio engineering my new economic center shifted. (I still miss part of my gear.)</p><p>I kept the microphones because they barely take up any space. In addition I only own one audio-interface now. It&#8217;s from RME. They are famous for their excellent analog-to-digital conversion. You get one of the best conversions you can buy for money &mdash; naturally it&#8217;s a keeper too. Another thing I couldn&#8217;t bring myself to part with were my speakers. In spite of using headphones almost all the time because my girlfriend doesn&#8217;t listen to such a wide variety of music as I do while working, it&#8217;s still good to know that I could cause a medium-sized earthquake with the speakers if I feel like it.</p><p>Lastly, I decided to order a smaller keyboard to at least leave the possibility open to produce a little bit in my spare time. Sadly I only managed to make one track per year since 2008. To look on the bright side of things I really amped up my front-end web design skills in that time.</p><h4>4. What software do you use and for what do you use it?</h4><p>There are so many great Mac apps out there in the wild and currently 465 of them are in my applications folder. Here&#8217;s a selection of the ones I use most on my Mac:</p><p><strong>Writing:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/\">nvALT</a> is my storage for text and code snippets, links to references, general references, lists and TaskPaper documents. It&#8217;s constantly open.</li><li><a href=\"http://www.foldingtext.com/\">FoldingText</a> is my go-to writing application. I just love the clean look, that it auto-formats Markdown and the possibility to fold sections. </li><li>When I&#8217;m writing longer articles or take-home exams I switch between FoldingText and <a href=\"http://multimarkdown.com/\">MultiMarkdown Composer</a>.</li><li>Since I write in Markdown all the time, no matter what, I often have <a href=\"http://markedapp.com/\">Marked</a> running to preview my documents.</li><li>I&#8217;m also a fan of outlines. <a href=\"https://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnioutliner/\">OmniOutliner Pro</a> and <a href=\"http://www.topoftree.jp/en/\">Tree</a> are often starting points for more elaborate projects.</li><li>When writing research papers for the University I use <a href=\"http://pomodoro.ugolandini.com/\">Pomodoro</a> because if I don&#8217;t I have trouble focusing on the job at hand.</li></ul><p><strong>Reading:</strong></p><p>On the Mac I use the Google Reader web application to read my feeds. I haven&#8217;t yet looked for an alternative for when the service shuts down. I might end up finally using the <a href=\"http://feverapp.com/\">Fever</a> installation I set up a while ago or even go back to <a href=\"http://www.netnewswireapp.com\">NetNewsWire</a>.</p><p>When I read on the Mac it&#8217;s usually in a browser. <a href=\"http://www.google.com/chrome\">Google Chrome</a> is my browser of choice. I&#8217;m a heavy <a href=\"http://www.pinboard.in/\">Pinboard</a> user and Chrome extensions are my favorite way of adding and searching my bookmarks.</p><p><strong>Coding:</strong></p><p>When I code a website I use <a href=\"https://www.panic.com/CODA/\">Coda 2</a> since it has smart features I still miss in other editors. I find it most helpful that Coda remembers my open tabs on a per project basis. Even more important, it remembers the split tabs where I grouped documents that are interacting with each other. It&#8217;s a great feature that I specially enjoy every time when revive an old project.</p><p>To preview websites on my mobile devices I use <a href=\"http://html.adobe.com/edge/inspect/\">Adobe&#8217;s Edge Inspect</a> and <a href=\"http://livereload.com/\">LiveReload</a>.</p><p>To store tutorials, references, books about web development and sites that inspire me I use <a href=\"http://reinventedsoftware.com/together/\">Together</a>. What I like about it is that it doesn&#8217;t use a single database file. I can drop files into specific folders and they automatically get tagged when I open Together.</p><p>If there is something to code and it is no website, then my favorite editor is <a href=\"http://www.sublimetext.com/\">Sublime Text 2</a> &mdash; if it would remember the split sets like Coda I&#8217;d instantly switch to it since it&#8217;s so highly customizable.</p><p>I also use <a href=\"http://www.git-tower.com/\">Tower</a> for managing my git repositories. Terminal and <a href=\"http://www.iterm2.com/\">iTerm</a> apps companions for my way through the shell.</p><p><strong>Designing:</strong></p><p>I&#8217;m paying Adobe to let me use their feature rich programs aka Photoshop and Illustrator.</p><p>To optimize images for the web I use <a href=\"http://jpegmini.com\">JPEGmini</a> and the hand-made <a href=\"http://imageoptim.com/\">ImageOptim</a> I wrote about in my blog.</p><p><strong>Audio:</strong></p><p>When it comes to listing I&#8217;m still undecided whether to stick with <a href=\"http://www.rdio.com/\">Rdio</a> or <a href=\"http://www.spotify.com/\">Spotify</a>. Both have drawbacks and great features.</p><p>For composing I use <a href=\"http://www.ableton.com/live\">Ableton Live</a> and <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/logicstudio/logicpro/\">Logic Pro</a> with an armada of plug-ins and virtual instruments.</p><p><strong>Miscellaneous:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.cocoatech.com/\">Path Finder</a> and Finder help me manage my files</li><li><a href=\"http://www.sparrowmailapp.com/\">Sparrow</a> is my default mail client.</li><li><a href=\"http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/TaskPaper\">TaskPaper</a>, <a href=\"http://projects.tynsoe.org/geektool/\">GeekTool</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnifocus/\">OmniFocus</a> build my GTD setup. OmniFocus is the main brain which keeps me from forgetting tasks. I prefer the Mac version over both of the iOS apps in terms of swiftness when it comes to organizing tasks.</li><li><a href=\"https://agilebits.com/onepassword\">1Password</a> is another application which is constantly open. I like to try a lot of new web services.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/\">Dropbox</a> keeps the main part of my system &mdash; be it files or preferences &mdash; in sync across all my Mac&#8217;s.</li><li>I use <a href=\"http://bjango.com/mac/istatmenus/\">iStat Menus</a> to keep an eye on my SSD&#8217;s disk space and my memory.</li><li>With <a href=\"http://myphonedesktop.com/\">myPhoneDesktop</a> and <a href=\"http://10base-t.com/macintosh-software/dropcopy/\">DropCopy Pro</a> I send files to iOS. Since my girlfriend is still running Snow Leopard, DropCopy is our go-to app for sharing files or links with each other.</li><li><a href=\"http://www.getcloudapp.com/\">CloudApp</a> is my favorite app for sharing Internet finds with my friends.</li><li><a href=\"http://flexibits.com/fantastical\">Fantastical</a> is the best way for me to get an overview of important upcoming events. It&#8217;s also the best way to add them to my calendar.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/aperture/\">Aperture</a> is my database for all personal photos.</li><li><a href=\"http://www.growl.info/\">Growl</a>, <a href=\"http://www.alarmsapp.com/\">Alarms</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.dueapp.com/\">Due</a> to remind to exercise, making a pause and to sit straight.</li><li>And… I use <a href=\"http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/\">Keyboard Maestro</a> for everything!</li></ul><p><strong>iOS &mdash; Work:</strong></p><p>On my iPhone and iPad I have about 350 apps each. A lot of them are tucked away in a folders. I keep barely-used applications around for easy access in case I really need them. A good example for rarely-used apps would be all the ones that are specific to my home town. On the iPad, however, I don&#8217;t have a lot of these specialists. But I have more folders with apps that I haven&#8217;t checked out yet. In any case, here&#8217;s what I use on a regular basis.</p><p>I write in <a href=\"http://agiletortoise.com/drafts\">Drafts</a> despite  preferring the Markdown toolbar of <a href=\"http://gokarbon.com/scratch/\">Scratch</a>. The iPad version of Drafts has one, and I&#8217;m still hoping that the iPhone gets one too some day.</p><p>If I need to make corrections to a post I open <a href=\"http://bywordapp.com/\">Byword</a> and edit the post. And while we&#8217;re at the blog, sometimes I have to open <a href=\"https://www.panic.com/prompt/\">Prompt</a> to analyze a problem or restart my Jekyll blog.</p><p>The header images for my blog are drawn in <a href=\"http://www.fiftythree.com/paper\">Paper</a>. I love its ease of use, the app is also the starting point for all of my mockups and general ideas for websites.</p><p>When I need to share files with someone I use Dropbox, ClouDrop for Cloudapp, or ClouDrop for Dropbox by <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/touchmiphone/id321133814\">TouchMyPhone</a>. If I want my screen shots on my Mac I use <a href=\"http://www.photosync-app.com/\">PhotoSync</a> since it&#8217;s faster than waiting for iCloud to sync the files in question.</p><p>For research I have couple of apps that most folks will be familiar with: <a href=\"http://albinadevelopment.com/pinbook\">Pinbook</a> and <a href=\"http://www.delibarapp.com/iphone/\">Delitouch iPhone</a> for browsing Pinboard, <a href=\"http://tapbots.com/software/tweetbot/\">Tweetbot</a>, <a href=\"http://kepner.me/apps/\">Bang On</a>, and Google Chrome.</p><p>In addition, I always have my iPhone at hand while reading &mdash; if there&#8217;s a need to clarify something I open up one of my Dictionaries. I have a couple for different purposes: linguistics ones, literature specific ones, and one for every coding language.</p><p>My RSS client of choice is <a href=\"http://reederapp.com/\">Reeder</a> on the iPhone and <a href=\"http://www.curioustimes.de/mrreader/index.html\">Mr. Reader</a> on the iPad. If I find something I like to act on or would like to link it goes into <a href=\"http://getpocket.com/\">Pocket</a>, and if it&#8217;s a longer read I send it to <a href=\"http://www.instapaper.com/iphone\">Instapaper</a> &mdash; both of these apps are jam-packed to the point that I doubt I can ever catch up with everything in there. If I&#8217;m about to continue working on another device I open the article in question with Google Chrome to ensure that I can resume where I left off.</p><p>Apart from reading feeds I also like to read books on the iPad. I collect them in my Dropbox and import them into iBooks via <a href=\"http://www.goodiware.com/goodreader.html\">GoodReader</a> or DropCopy. If it&#8217;s a shorter PDF I read it directly in GoodReader.</p><p>When I study for a test I use <a href=\"http://orangeorapple.com/Flashcards/\">Flashcards Deluxe</a>. I have a macro which formats a Markdown document of my study notes into the format that the app reads. The macro also puts the file into my Dropbox. All I have to do is to import the file and start learning.</p><p>Beforehand I admitted that I barely use my scanner. I digitalize University or office documents most of the times with <a href=\"http://readdle.com/products/scanner_pro\">Scanner Pro</a> and send them directly to my Dropbox.</p><p>While we&#8217;re still in the category of work related apps that I use most frequently, there are some classics that are hits on the iPhone for a reason. These ones are on my Homes creen:  <a href=\"http://appcubby.com/launch-center/\">LaunchCenterPro</a>, <a href=\"http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnifocus-iphone/\">OmniFocus</a>, <a href=\"http://www.sparrowmailapp.com/iphone.php\">Sparrow</a>, <a href=\"https://agilebits.com/onepassword/ios\">1Password</a>, <a href=\"http://flexibits.com/fantastical-iphone\">Fantastical</a>, and the TomTom navigation app.</p><p>I mentioned in the beginning that health plays a big role for me when it comes to work. Here&#8217;s one of my shorter morning rituals and the apps I use with it: my day starts with two glasses of water, then I put my bluetooth headphones on, fire up Spotify and select some relaxing music for my Yoga exercises. <a href=\"http://www.repeattimerapp.com/\">Repeat Timer Pro</a> is the best app I found so far for basic interval training.</p><p>To conclude this section about apps I use for working, I also want to end with Spotify since music can increase creativity and help to focus better. I often use my iPhone or iPad to play music instead of my Mac. Unlike the Mac version of Spotify the mobile app doesn&#8217;t chuck away on my upload stream. I send the audio signal to <a href=\"http://www.rogueamoeba.com/airfoil/\">Airfoil Speakers</a> on my Mac and I&#8217;m good. Furthermore, to focus while studying I have a binaural playlist on Spotify and this little collection of apps: <a href=\"http://www.dataca.com/Attractor.html\">Attractor</a>, <a href=\"http://www.redpiston.com/our_work.php\">MindWave 2</a>, and some <a href=\"http://www.teslasoftware.com/\">AmbiScience</a> apps.</p><p><strong>iOS &mdash; Everyday Life:</strong></p><p>My smartphone has alleviated my everyday life, that&#8217;s for sure. Here are some key aspects where I find it utterly useful:</p><p><a href=\"http://notesy-app.com/\">Notesy</a> is one of the most important apps on my phone. Everything that&#8217;s inside of nvALT is also in Notesy, for instance when I plan to cook something new I save the recipe in my notes folder and have the Markdown preview right in front of me. I have an array of <a href=\"http://www.dueapp.com/\">Due</a> timers for cooking and baking.</p><p>If I&#8217;m not working it is highly likely that I have my headphones on and listen to a podcast via <a href=\"http://www.downcastapp.com/\">Downcast</a> or even better, an audiobook (I&#8217;m a sucker for audiobooks).</p><p>The iPhone is also my main camera, so <a href=\"http://campl.us\">Camera+</a> and the default camera app are on my Home screen to make sure I can easily access them any time. I sold my regular cameras because the iPhone suits my needs just fine. I&#8217;m the point-and-click guy when it comes to capturing moments, and it&#8217;s enough for me.</p><p>Another thing I like to do on iOS is to remote control my Mac with <a href=\"http://www.stairways.com/iphone/\">Keyboard Maestro Control</a> or <a href=\"http://www.iteleportmobile.com/\">iTeleport</a>. Most of the time it&#8217;s nothing important but it&#8217;s a nice feature I like to use when I&#8217;m on the couch.</p><p>The last big point where the iPhone shines for me is it helps me to keep track of&#8230;</p><ul><li>my lists with <a href=\"http://listaryapp.com/\">Listary</a>;</li><li>cartoons and series I&#8217;m following with <a href=\"http://www.itvshowsapp.com/\">iTV Shows</a>;</li><li>movies I want to see in the cinema with <a href=\"http://www.taphive.com/todomovies/\">TodoMovies</a> (side note: I hope to see a <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/\">Letterboxd</a> app some day);</li><li>apps that I want to buy with <a href=\"http://appshopper.com/\">AppShopper</a>;</li><li>the weather with <a href=\"http://www.weatherpro.eu/\">WeatherPro</a> (which has proven to be the most reliable app for Europe, but not the most beautiful), and <a href=\"http://www.rainalarmapp.com/\">RainAlarm</a> (since there is no Dark Sky for Europe).</li></ul><h4>5. How does this setup help you do your best creative work?</h4><p>At some point in my twenties I suddenly realized that I had back pain many a time, that I gained some weight, and that my mood swings were in fact a full-grown chronic depression. It was obvious that I couldn&#8217;t perform my best under these circumstances.</p><p>To fight all of the above I started to do Yoga along with some other exercises, to eat more healthy and to create a work environment which makes me happy. In the last 5 years I managed to drop the extra 22 pounds (10 kg) I gained beforehand and developed an interest in cooking which revealed that one&#8217;s own kitchen can serve better food than 90-percent of the restaurants in the close vicinity. These measures lead to fewer periods of depression which I&#8217;m very thankful for.</p><p>If you work on a desk with a monitor in front of your face from dusk till dawn, then time truly flies. I get easily distracted; I even managed to ignore my own health. By taking breaks and exercising I find myself to be more cheerful, recharged, and overall a bit healthier. It&#8217;s a wonder by all the optimizations I made to tweak my operating system that it took so long for me to recognize that my body&#8217;s &#8220;OS&#8221; also was in need of more organization and maintenance.</p><p>My point with the 3 paragraphs above is that a healthy body is the only way for me to not drop into a hole of darkness. My other tactic to reduce the likeliness of such a thing happening is to surround myself with stuff that makes me happy. That&#8217;s why I called the constituents of my playful environment &#8220;health appliances&#8221;.</p><p>To keep this system running, a good part of my setup consists of different ways to remind me to eat, exercise, and take a break. I change those reminders regularly so that I don&#8217;t get too accustomed to one set, otherwise I would sit on my Mac non-stop and forget everything around me. I don&#8217;t know the feeling of being bored when I&#8217;m in front of one of my gadgets. Combined with decent internet access they work like a creativity accelerator for me. I always find stuff to do and have a variety of lists where I gather different creative projects.</p><p>The Mac and iOS devices do a splendid job at reminding me of my goals and showing me what I could and should do next. The only glitch in the system is me, since it&#8217;s me who sometimes ignores the good advice and gets lost in a side-project.</p><h4>6. How would your ideal setup look and function?</h4><p>A 13-inch MacBook would be sufficient for me to get things done &mdash; I&#8217;ve worked with one for years. But since I&#8217;m allowed to dream a little bit, here we go:</p><p>I would love to trade in the two 24-inch displays for one larger retina display. I hope Apple has something in the pipe to can make the Retina Cinema Display work over Thunderbolt &mdash; from what I&#8217;ve read Thunderbolt could be the bottleneck there.</p><p>Particularly with regard to the high energy consumption of the Mac Pro in combination with the two monitors, I can imagine a more lightweight solution. My number one requirement would be a retina display &mdash; be it an iMac or a MacBook with a large retina Cinema Display. The next technical condition would be a multi-bay enclosures that is <em>silent</em>, affordable, and fast (think Thunderbolt) to make up for the 4 drive bays which I would leave behind. I just don&#8217;t see the latter three conditions happening at the moment.</p><p>Speaking of gadgets, here are some more realistic purchases I plan to acquire. I think an <a href=\"http://adonit.net/jot/pro/\">Adonit Jot Pro</a> might do a better job when writing things in the Papers app, and another nice addition to my setup would be the <a href=\"http://www.twelvesouth.com/products/plugbugworld/\">Twelve South PlugBug World</a>.</p><p>Besides the above mentioned, switching to a lightweight setup feels far away. Some of my gear speaks another language: my MacBook&#8217;s display for instance. The right side on my smallest Mac is malfunctioning &mdash; it flickers like crazy. Sooner or later the computer needs to get replaced. The next defect device is my bluetooth Sennheiser. I dropped it on a marble floor because the carabiner with which I attached it to my Ristretto bag snapped open while I was fumbling in the bag. I was toying with the idea of switching the brand. The problem is, I only know of one pair of bluetooth headphones that has no problems switching between multiple bluetooth devices, but it isn&#8217;t on par with the Sennheiser quality-wise. So my wish would be a good set of headphones where switching from the Mac to my iPhone or iPad is effortlessly possible. Luckily Airfoil exists and so I will swallow the bitter pill and send in my Sennheiser as soon as I have enough cash to pay for the costly repairing.</p><p>Since I talked keyboards before, if I were to buy a new MacBook, this time I would order one with a genuine US English keyboard. And in addition, after reading about <a href=\"http://shawnblanc.net/2012/06/brett-terpstras-sweet-mac-setup/\">Brett Terpstra&#8217;s switch to the bluetooth aluminum keyboard here on the Sweet Mac Setups</a>, I can picture myself trying to make the switch to a bluetooth keyboard for my desktop Mac too. I was afraid that I would miss all the lovely extra options for additional shortcuts which a numeric keypad provides, but there are other ways to work around that. A bluetooth keyboard would also work great with the iPad.</p><p>The last item on the wish list gadget-wise is a NAS. I&#8217;ve being comparing the pros and cons of a NAS vs. a Mac mini lately, and at the moment a NAS server from Synology has the best chances to be one of my next investments. Okay, since this part of Sweet Mac Setups is encouraging dreaming it would be a NAS at home and a Mac mini from Macminicolo.net (which I just can&#8217;t afford anytime soon) to have my own powerful server.</p><p>That&#8217;s about it for the gadgets. In terms of a better workflow I wish that I&#8217;d already have a more automated way to post on my blog. On the Mac it&#8217;s already happening, but my goal from the beginning was to make it work with the iPad too. I&#8217;d like to send my drawings from the Paper app to my (shared) server. Federico Viticci&#8217;s has a crazy cool Pythonista workflow, and I hope to get there too. On the server the images should get optimized, filed into my upload directory and the corresponding Markdown image links should be appended to a scratch file.</p><p>Another workflow issue I have is when I write something for University. Sometimes Markdown doesn&#8217;t cut the chase. Here, with all the footnotes, citations, annotations and references Pandoc sounds like the better solution. I definitely have to look into it (… and Scrivener).</p><p>There&#8217;s also an application wish I have had for a long time: Listary for Dropbox. I&#8217;d like to keep everything that closely resembles a note inside my nvALT folder and I still haven&#8217;t found a better list app than Listary.</p><p>Lastly, some enhancements for my work environment: I want some nice graffiti for the concrete bricks on my desk.</p><p>Almost all of the above is not really important. Like I stated in the beginning. A 13-inch MacBook is enough to get the work done. But there are things that would be great long-term investments. By far my biggest wish is a fancy desk which is adjustable in height so that I can switch from working in a chair to working on a standing desk. The best thing I come across so far is the <a href=\"http://www.anthro.com/products/elevate-adjusta\">Anthro Elevate Adjusta</a> (check out <a href=\"http://youtu.be/AeUFcGiQznw\">this</a> YoutTube video for a short demo of the basic functions).</p><p>Along the lines of a more ergonomic workspace my second biggest wish is <a href=\"http://www.sanaform-falto.de/section/products/collection/falto-organic/wip_27__________wip_37.html\">the Falto Wip 37</a>. I tested it on a trade show years ago and have fallen in love with it since.</p><p>That&#8217;s it. Sorry for being a chatterbox and breaking the character count record here on Sweet Mac Setups.</p><h3>More Sweet Setups</h3><p>Patrick&#8217;s setup is one in <a href=\"http://shawnblanc.net/sweet-mac-setups/\">a series of sweet Mac Setups</a>.</p>

The newest and best incarnation of the Kone filter (I think this is the third version Able has made), as well as its accompanying custom fabricated brewing system, were <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/333965871/kone-coffee-filter-brewing-system\">Kickstarted</a> thirty times over last June.</p><p>I backed at the $125 level, which got me the whole brewing system with filter as a reward. And it all arrived about two weeks ago. I&#8217;ve since brewed 4 pots of coffee with my Kone Brewing System and they&#8217;ve all been quite delicious.</p><h3>The Brewing System</h3><iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/62101362\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe><p>The first thing I noticed after opening the box is how big the Kone Brewing System is. I was expecting the Brewing System would hold around 500ml of coffee, but it actually can hold twice that amount.</p><p>The Brewing System is made up of four components: the pot, the filter, the filter casing, and the lid.</p><p><img class=\"leftb\" src=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/kone_brewing_system.jpg\" width=\"460\" title=\"Kone Brewing System Components\" alt=\"Kone Brewing System Components\" /></p><p>When brewing, the filter rests inside the casing which rests on top of the pot. When done, you remove the top casing (using the rubber heat shield grip), and place the lid on top of the pot.</p><p>It&#8217;s an extremely handsome rig, and I&#8217;m very impressed with the design. It looks great on the breakfast or dinner table, and it looks great sitting on the shelf in our kitchen.</p><p>There is no doubt that the guys at Able put a lot of thought and attention into the entire Kone Brewing System. Everything &mdash; from the packaging to the included card of instructions to the filter and ceramic pot themselves &mdash; exudes attention to detail, care, and thoughtfulness.</p><p>Alas, the Kone Brewing System can only be used with the Kone filter. The ceramic top-piece which holds the filter is, as I mentioned, custom fabricated specifically for the Kone filter. There is no internal &#8220;V&#8221; shape which could accommodate a paper filter if you wanted &mdash; you must use the Kone metal filter.</p><h3>The Kone Filter</h3><p>They say the advantages of using a metal filter rather than paper are: (1) reusable; (2) you never have to pay for paper filters again; and (3) metal filters allow more oils from the coffee bean to pass through when brewing, thus making a fuller cup of coffee</p><p>You can&#8217;t argue with 1 and 2. And if you are making a big pot of pour over every single day, in the long run a metal filter will pay for itself.</p><p>As for the taste. Well, I personally haven&#8217;t been able to tell any significant difference between a cup of coffee brewed with a paper filter and one brewed with a metal filter. In fact, if I had to chose, I&#8217;d pick paper filters.</p><p>The AeroPress is certainly my favorite brewing contraption, and I use paper filters with it. I even have a metal disk filter that fits my AeroPress and I haven&#8217;t noticed any difference when using it rather than the paper filters.</p><p>One of the disadvantages to using a metal filter is that some of the &#8220;coffee dust&#8221; gets through the filter and into the bottom of your cup of coffee. Such as the grit you get when brewing with a normal french press.</p><h3>Daily Brew?</h3><p>When it comes to the day-to-day practicality of using the Kone Brewing System, it is not going to be my new daily driver.</p><p>For one: compared to the AeroPress or v60, cleanup of the Kone is more involved and tedious because I have to rinse and scrub the filter to get the coffee grinds out of it. Secondly, the Kone Brewing System is intended for making several servings of coffee &mdash; it&#8217;s a lot of coffee gear to use and clean for the 10-ounce cup I usually brew each morning.</p><p>I see the Kone Brewing System as being akin to my <a href=\"http://toolsandtoys.net/coffee-siphon-vacuum-pot/\">Siphon vacuum pot</a>. The Siphon is quite impractical for day-to-day use, but it&#8217;s great for when company is over because it&#8217;s so fun to use. The Kone is in a similar category (making table-side pourover is always fun), and it can make almost 3 times as much coffee as my siphon.</p><p>If however, I was regularly brewing a larger pot of coffee instead of just my single cup, then a big pour over pot like this is just what I would use each day.</p><p>If you already own the Kone filter, the Brewing System is $120 by itself. Otherwise it&#8217;s $160 with the filter.</p><p>Being one of the Kickstarter backers I was privy to much of the behind-the-scenes of what goes in to the molding, firing, and packaging of the Kone Brewing System. And without significant economies of scale, $160 is probably as affordable as Able could get it. Which is unfortunate because as much as I like the Kone Brewing System, $160 is a hard price to swallow.</p><p>My verdict?</p><p>As cool and attractive as it is, it&#8217;s incredibly hard to justify the extra cost of the Kone Brewing System over a Chemex. The Chemex is just as capable of a coffee maker, but it&#8217;s one-third the price, holds 10-percent more liquid, works great with the Kone filter, and also works with paper filters.</p>

It&#8217;s hooked up to a <a href=\"http://reviews.cnet.com/lcd-monitors/dell-ultrasharp-2407wfp/4505-3174_7-31899303.html\">Dell 24&#8243; monitor</a> that&#8217;s a bit older than the Mac. The screen is still color-accurate when calibrated (with a <a href=\"http://spyder.datacolor.com/display-calibration/\">Datacolor Spyder</a>), and I&#8217;m fine with the size, but I&#8217;m dying to replace it with something more densely pixeled. A Retina desktop monitor can&#8217;t come soon enough.</p><p>I sit next to a large window, which is nice for sanity but bad for color accuracy. The windows have opaque shutters I can close when doing color critical work.</p><p>The Mac&#8217;s hard drive bays are all in use: Bay 1 is my SSD boot drive &mdash; it&#8217;s fast but small, so I have my Documents, Downloads, and Pictures folders <a href=\"http://gigaom.com/2011/04/27/how-to-create-and-use-symlinks-on-a-mac/\">symlinked</a> to a drive in Bay 2. My iTunes media is on a drive in Bay 3. And Bay 4 has a drive for scratch purposes and other temporary storage.</p><p>I have a <a href=\"http://www.wdc.com/en/products/external/desktopformac/\">Western Digital MyBook</a> that keeps backups of the drives in Bays 1 &amp; 2 via Time Machine. At some point I accumulated a second MyBook that I keep around as a <a href=\"http://macsparky.com/blog/2009/9/8/screencast-17-magic-install-disk.html\">Magic Install Disk</a> which has come in surprisingly handy.</p><p>I replaced the SuperDrive with a Blu-Ray burner even though optical media is on the decline, because I still like having a <a href=\"http://dpbestflow.org/backup/backup-overview#write\">write-once copy</a> of my photo archive as a last resort backup. I take comfort knowing it&#8217;s impossible to accidentally overwrite a file with a corrupt or altered version. So after every 25 GB of shooting, I burn a disc.</p><p>I have a <a href=\"http://drobo.com/products/index.php\">Drobo</a> (2nd generation) which holds the primary copy of my photo archive. Every photo I&#8217;ve ever shot digitally for personal or freelance work is connected live and easily accessible.</p><p>I use a <a href=\"http://www.wacom-asia.com/intuos3/\">6&#215;8 Wacom Intuos3</a> stylus, switching between mouse and pen more or less equally depending on the task. I own an <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/keyboard/\">Apple wireless keyboard</a>, but tend to use the wired keyboard because I like having a number pad.</p><p>Both my household and business are mostly paperless. For document scanning I use a <a href=\"http://www.fujitsu.com/us/services/computing/peripherals/scanners/scansnap/s300m.html\">Fujitsu ScanSnap S300M</a>. I have a physical inbox currently backlogged with stuff to be scanned.</p><p>My monitor has neither camera nor microphone, so I use an old Logitech webcam for rare video chatting and occasional dictation. I&#8217;m much more likely to use my iPhone for video chat, usually down on the floor with my son chatting with my parents.</p><p>My secondary Mac is a Late 2011 <a href=\"http://support.apple.com/kb/sp644\">15&#8243; MacBook Pro</a>. I don&#8217;t use it most days. It&#8217;s mainly for when I&#8217;m shooting tethered on location or traveling and need something more than an iPad.</p><p>I have a <a href=\"http://www.brother-usa.com/Printer/ModelDetail/1/hl2170w/Overview#.UUMuMFspKvU\">Brother HL-2170W</a> laser printer for document printing, and an <a href=\"http://www.epson.com/cgi-bin/Store/consumer/consDetail.jsp?oid=53540920\">Epson R2400</a> for photo printing.</p><p>I usually sit in a <a href=\"http://www.humanscale.com/products/freedom-video.cfm\">Humanscale Freedom</a> task chair (the no-headrest model) I got cheap from a company going out of business. It&#8217;s okay.</p><h4>Why this rig?</h4><p>It&#8217;s the first Mac I ever bought. Here is my <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2-UuIEOcss\">switch</a> story:</p><p>I&#8217;ve always been fairly Apple/PC ambidextrous. Our first family computer was an Apple II (well, a <a href=\"http://www.ironicsans.com/2010/02/they_dont_make_computer_manual.html\">clone</a>). Sometime in the early 90s we got a PC and I learned to use DOS and Windows. Eventually I took that PC with me to college and my parents replaced it with a Mac. When I moved to New York in 1997, just starting out on my own with a small income, I bought another PC. I didn&#8217;t think Macs were as affordable, and I already had a lot of Windows software I would need to buy again for the Mac, so a PC worked well for me.</p><p>At the same time, I started working in the photo studio at <a href=\"http://christies.com/\">Christie&#8217;s</a> auction house. They had just transitioned to a fully digital workflow, a very rare thing in 1997. They were using Macs, so that&#8217;s what I used by day, and then went home to my Windows machine. Eventually I left Christie&#8217;s to become the staff photographer at <a href=\"http://www.polo.com/\">Polo Ralph Lauren</a> which insisted I used Windows for corporate reasons. But I continued to be adept at both platforms.</p><p>In 2007, I decided to quit my cushy life as a staff photographer and go freelance. I updated my computer to the latest, fastest, and greatest Dell computer I could afford, and it came with the latest and greatest version of Windows: Vista. It was garbage. I hated everything about it.</p><p>2007 is also when I moved in with my soon-to-be wife, a graphic designer who had a Mac. Watching her use OS X while I struggled with Vista made it harder to tolerate my own computer. Software for the Mac was more abundant than ever, and the games I used to play on the PC were less important to me.</p><p>So in early 2008 I took the plunge. I&#8217;d had a good first year as a freelancer, so I could afford to trade up. I got rid of the Vista machine and went all-in with the Mac described above. I kept the Dell monitor. Apple&#8217;s switch to Intel gave me confidence that if I really needed a Windows application I couldn&#8217;t replace on the Mac I could still run it in a Virtual Machine, and that made the switch easy. I haven&#8217;t looked back.</p><h4>What software do you use and for what do you use it?</h4><p>Specific to my work:</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom.html\">Lightroom</a> for the majority of my photo image editing and maintaining my archive.</li><li><a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html\">Photoshop</a> for retouching, but less and less as Lightroom gains more powerful non-destructive capabilities that use all the photo&#8217;s raw data.</li><li>Since I do a lot of video these days, I recently updated to the entire <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/creativesuite/mastercollection.html\">Adobe CS6 Master Collection</a> and use <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html\">Adobe Premiere Pro</a>. I had been using Final Cut Pro but found Premiere to be more stable and faster, despite some nice features I miss from FCP. I purchased the full version instead of getting a Creative Cloud subscription.</li><li><a href=\"http://www.parallels.com/\">Parallels</a> so I can use <a href=\"http://quickbooks.intuit.com/\">QuickBooks</a> for Windows, to make things easier for my accountant.</li></ul><p>More generally useful apps I use.

I&#8217;ve been getting back into comics this year after an extended absence, and this is such a great way to catch up on all the story lines I missed over the years. Yeah, there are bugs (not her fault) and the occasional missing issue in the middle of a story here and there, but I&#8217;m sure those things will be ironed out. There is just so much great content here. Access to 13,000+ comics from 70 years of Marvel history for so little money is such a bargain.</li></ul><h4>How does this setup help you do your best creative work?</h4><p>I&#8217;m not sure my current physical setup does much for me creatively, to be honest. It&#8217;s mainly the software, and in that sense I benefit from the work other people did. Other people figured out what&#8217;s needed in a good video editor before I ever started shooting video. Other people figured out how to capture raw photo data and how to get the most from it. Other people solved a lot of technical problems for me before I even knew I had them. Because of those engineers, obstacles get out of my way and let me just concentrate on getting things done.</p><h4>How would your ideal setup look and function?</h4><p>The biggest thing I would change in my setup is its location. I enjoy having a home office, but it&#8217;s not isolated enough from the rest of my living space. This makes it tough to separate work from life. I could really use an extra room as my office.</p><p>Next, I&#8217;d get rid of wires. Unfortunately wireless tech isn&#8217;t quite a match for my needs right now, but I hope that changes soon.</p><p>Also, I&#8217;d have a camera bag that was bigger on the inside than the outside, stores all the gear I need for travel and location work, fits in an overhead bin, and barely weighs anything.</p><h3>More Sweet Setups</h3><p>David&#8217;s setup is one in <a href=\"http://shawnblanc.net/sweet-mac-setups/\">a series of sweet Mac Setups</a>.</p>

I sigh a sigh of relief when my thoughts, plans, ideas, to-do items, and everything else is filed away &#8230; <a href=\"http://shawnblanc.net/2013/03/rego-review/\">(More)</a>") (content:encoded nil "<p>There are two types of people:</p><ul><li>Those who like lists.</li><li>Those who don&#8217;t.</li></ul><p>I like lists. I like lists of lists. I sigh a sigh of relief when my thoughts, plans, ideas, to-do items, and everything else is filed away and in some sort of order.</p><p><em>A place for everything, and everything in its place.</em></p><p>My inclination towards putting things in lists combined with my affinity for well-designed iPhone apps is why I enjoyed Gowalla (R.I.P.) so much until it shut down a few years ago. Gowalla was such a fun and well-deigned app, and I loved using it as a way to <a href=\"http://shawnblanc.net/2010/08/gowalla/\">catalog my journey of places I&#8217;d been</a>.</p><p>Though Gowalla was a social network, I wasn&#8217;t really into it for the social aspect. I liked Gowalla because I could create trips (a list of recommended places), and I could log the places I&#8217;d been (a list of past visits).</p><p>In fact, the social aspect of Gowalla was more of a turn off than a feature. Gowalla&#8217;s built-in social network meant I had to strongly police who my followers were or else censor the places I checked in to. I chose the former which meant every time I opened the app I saw the list of unanswered friend requests and felt I was being a jerk by ignoring them.</p><p>The same is true for Path, and it&#8217;s why I never used it as often as I&#8217;d have liked. I just didn&#8217;t want the burden of managing the social aspect of the app in order to get at the journalling and logging aspect.</p><p>I&#8217;m already active on Twitter and App.net and don&#8217;t want yet another social network.</p><p>My standoffishness towards new social networks (especially ones that encourage me to broadcast when I am and am not at my own home) is one reason I love the journaling app <a href=\"http://shawnblanc.net/2012/08/day-one-review/\">Day One</a>. Day One has some parallels to a &#8220;private&#8221; social network. Meaning, I can post a status update or a whole journal entry, and they can include images or be nothing <em>but</em> an image. And the location, date, and even current weather are all automatically added to my entry.</p><p>Day One takes many of the journalling and logging elements found in Path, Gowalla, Facebook, and the like, but Day One has no social network. And that&#8217;s one of the many attractive things about it.</p><h4>Enter Rego</h4><p><a href=\"http://www.regoapp.com/\">Rego</a> is a brand new, location-based app that fills the void left by Gowalla &mdash; and Rego is not a new social network.</p><p><img class=\"leftb\" src=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/rego-collections.jpg\" height=\"568\" width=\"320\" title=\"Rego\" alt=\"Rego\" /></p><p>The basic premise of Rego is as a personal travel log and list. Like Gowalla, you can add a place based on your current location. But, unlike Gowalla, you can also add places you are not at, or have never even been to (more on that later).</p><p>Rego has many of the cool things found in a location-based social network app, but without rewards, badges, pins, or mayors. Rego has no rules, no goals, and no friend requests. It&#8217;s just a personal list of all your places. And this is something I find quite refreshing.</p><h4>Selectively Social</h4><p><a href=\"http://bobulate.com/post/45488204334/inexactitude\">Liz Danzico:</a></p><blockquote><p>The divide between the connected and unconnected continues to demonstrate an economic discord: those living comfortably are also living un-connectedly. Unubiquitious computing demands have inspired developers to rush to build unconnected communities. The new <em>connected</em> is to be <em>disconnected</em>. Deadspots are the new hotspots.</p></blockquote><p>What I like about Rego versus Gowalla, Path, Foursquare, and others, is that Rego is selectively social. It&#8217;s not a social network, but I can share any of my places if I want.</p><p>If I want to share my favorite coffee shop or the trailhead to a cool 4&#215;4 trail, then I can. Any place I have in Rego I can choose to share.</p><p>Rego does this by creating a unique URL of my shared place that includes the name and location, and, if I want, any of the images or notes that I&#8217;ve added to that place.</p><p><img class=\"leftb\" src=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/rego-sharing.jpg\" height=\"568\" width=\"320\" title=\"Sharing a place in Rego\" alt=\"Sharing a place in Rego\" /></p><p>For example, <a href=\"http://www.regoapp.com/p/lI8luagMxC\">here&#8217;s a link to Quay Coffee</a>, a place I have in my Rego. If you click that link, you&#8217;ll see the location of Quay as well as a picture I took earlier this week and a note I added to that image.</p><p>I can share the Quay link any way I would share any other link &mdash; I can email it, text message it, tweet it, etc. &mdash; but since Rego is not a social network, I don&#8217;t have to manage incoming follower requests deciding who I want to allow to see <em>all</em> the places I bookmark. I <em>choose</em> what places I want to share, and even who I share them with.</p><p>That&#8217;s what I mean by Rego being selectively social &mdash; there are dozens of other places I have in Rego that are known only to me.</p><h4>Adding Places</h4><p>Adding a place in Rego is a snap. As well it should be, considering it&#8217;s the chief function of the app.</p><p>You launch the app, and the map finds your location. You then tap the &#8220;plus&#8221; icon in the upper right corner, enter the name of the place you&#8217;re adding, and hit Save.</p><p>Once you&#8217;ve added a new place, you can then close Rego and return to doing whatever you were doing earlier. Or you can add more information to your place such as images and notes, or add it to a collection (even multiple collections).</p><p>In my <a href=\"http://shawnblanc.net/2010/08/gowalla/\">review of Gowalla</a> a few years ago, I listed out a few of the things I loved most (such as building trips) as well as things I most wished were a part of the app (such as adding a location without physically being in that spot). Rego has answers for both of these things.</p><p>Because Rego lets you put places into multiple collections I can easily build trips and lists. And since Rego lets you add a location even if you&#8217;re not physically standing there with your iPhone in hand, I can add places I <em>want</em> to visit, in addition to adding places I&#8217;ve been to but not since I installed Rego.</p><p>To add a place you aren&#8217;t currently at you simply move the map around until the cross hairs are where you want them to be. Then you tap the &#8220;plus&#8221; button to add the place and a red pin will drop right where the crosshairs were pointed.</p><p>Unfortunately there is no ability to search for a place. Which means: (a) there is no auto-suggest for the location you&#8217;re currently at; and (b) when adding a place that is somewhere other than your current location, you kinda have to eyeball it with the crosshairs and the map (I&#8217;m told that the 1.1 update of Rego will use Foursquare&#8217;s search API to help you find and add locations easier).</p><h4>Collections</h4><p>As I mentioned above, once you&#8217;ve added a place, it consists of three things: (1) the location, (2) any photos and text notes you want to add to your place, and (3) a collection.</p><p>Collections are just lists. A place can be added to multiple collections. So <a href=\"http://www.regoapp.com/p/d95fMe1lnr\">my favorite coffee shop</a> can be placed in my &#8220;Coffee Joints&#8221; collection, as well as my &#8220;Faves&#8221; collection, and even my &#8220;Colorado Summer Vacation&#8221; collection if I want.</p><p>Earlier this week I spent the afternoon and drove around to each of my favorite coffee shops in Kansas City. These coffee shops are all in a collection within my Rego app called &#8220;Coffee Joints&#8221;:</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.regoapp.com/p/lI8luagMxC\">Quay</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.regoapp.com/p/GGwu1Sng5l\">Broadway Cafe</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.regoapp.com/p/RTzRVzqNm6\">Oddly Correct</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.regoapp.com/p/5vwv9F880Y\">Roasterie in Leawood</a> (and <a href=\"http://www.regoapp.com/p/3k80l2ARjL\">in Brookside</a>)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.regoapp.com/p/DQb7aNxnzm\">Cafe Main</a></li></ul><p>I&#8217;ve also started building a collection of my favorite hole-in-the-wall BBQ spots in Kansas City.<a class=\"fn\" href=\"#XXX_fn1\" id=\"XXX_fnr1\">1</a></p><p>It would be great to be able to share an entire collection if I wanted to. Have an acquaintance passing through and they want to know where to get the best Americano and the best pulled pork sandwich? <em>Here, check out these two lists. You can&#8217;t go wrong at any of these joints.</em><a class=\"fn\" href=\"#XXX_fn2\" id=\"XXX_fnr2\">2</a> And since I can also chose to share any notes I&#8217;ve taken of a place, I can include recommendations for what to order.<a class=\"fn\" href=\"#XXX_fn3\" id=\"XXX_fnr3\">3</a></p><p>All this while having the freedom to keep my other places (such as my home, my in-law&#8217;s home, a vacation rental, and a favorite camping spot) completely to myself.</p><p>If you&#8217;ve clicked on one of the above coffee shop links, you&#8217;ll have noticed that when someone views a shared location they can see all the info I&#8217;ve chosen to share about that location (I can <em>just</em> share the pin drop if I want to &mdash; I don&#8217;t have to share any of my images or notes related to that location).</p><p>When viewing a shared location, if you have Rego installed on your iPhone, you can import the location and notes to your own list of places. If you&#8217;re viewing the place on an iPad or Mac that won&#8217;t have Rego installed, or if you&#8217;re on your iPhone and just don&#8217;t want to import the location, a link appears over top of the map to open the location in Google maps.</p><h4>Planning a Trip</h4><p>Since you can add locations you&#8217;re not physically at, you can use Rego to plan a trip &mdash; dropping pins at all the places you want to visit, and even adding notes about that place.</p><p>Unfortunately, since Rego does not yet have the ability to search for a place, you&#8217;ll have to eyeball it when adding places. If you&#8217;ve got a lot of trails, restaurants, and other landmarks you want to visit next time you&#8217;re, say, in the Rocky Mountains, you may find building out an entire week&#8217;s worth of excursions takes a bit of time.</p><p>I&#8217;ve built a collection for my Summer vacation to the Rocky Mountains, which includes a few restaurants we want to visit and some 4&#215;4 trails we want to hit. I can then use Rego to instantly pull up the places we want to visit and get directions.</p><p>To get directions to a place, tap the standard iOS &#8220;Share&#8221; icon in the top right corner. Then select &#8220;Open In&#8230;&#8221; and Rego will give you the option to open the location in Apple Maps, as well as Google Maps and/or the TomTom app if you have those installed. Then, you can use your way-finding app of choice to get directions to your place.</p><p>Also worth noting, is that you can reorient the map by tapping and holding. When you do this a purple pin will drop and then all the locations in Rego will be sorted by distance from the purple pin rather than from your current location. This can be helpful for, say, getting an idea of the proximity all your planned excursions are from where you&#8217;ll be staying.</p><h4>Data Export</h4><p>Alas, currently there is no way to get your data out of Rego. Though all your info is stored locally on your iPhone, if you ever decide to stop using Rego there&#8217;s no way to get your data out. I&#8217;m told that export is a feature they are working on and will be added to a future release.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Rego is <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/rego-bookmark-your-favorite/id603544163?mt=8\">available now</a> as a free download, and allows you to add up to 10 places. To add more places than that, there is a $2.99 in-app purchase (which is currently on a launch-price sale of $0.99). This is Rego&#8217;s way of offering a &#8220;try before you buy&#8221; version.</p><p>While I do see some overlap between how one might use both Rego and Day One &mdash; because both allow you to log &#8220;Moments&#8221; with images, notes, and your location &mdash; I see both as being useful.</p><p>For me, Rego is the place where I log my favorite spots, recommended spots, and spots I want to visit. And sure, an image or two can be added to give some flair to the saved location entry, but for recording memories, I&#8217;ll continue to use Day One.</p><p>All in all, Rego 1.0 is a fantastic app with some great features and functionality. The lack of social features mean it&#8217;s not one more app you have to &#8220;manage&#8221; and &#8220;check in&#8221; on. It&#8217;s an app you use if and when you want &mdash; it doesn&#8217;t bug you to use it all the time. This is precisely what I like so much about it.</p><div class=\"footnotes\"><hr /><ol><li id=\"XXX_fn1\">Which will include Okie Joe&#8217;s, L.C.&#8217;s, Arthur Bryant&#8217;s, and (for those who need a place with a nice atmosphere) Jack Stack. <a href=\"#XXX_fnr1\" title=\"Back To Top\">&#8629;</a></li><li id=\"XXX_fn2\">Of course, a situation like the above is exactly where an app like Foursquare would shine. The social aspect of the app makes it easy to aggregate the &#8220;most popular&#8221; locations. But I&#8217;ve never had trouble getting a recommendation by asking for one on Twitter or looking on Yelp. <a href=\"#XXX_fnr2\" title=\"Back To Top\">&#8629;</a></li><li id=\"XXX_fn3\">At Broadway, get espresso. At Quay (pronounce it &#8220;key&#8221;), get a pour over. At Okie Joe&#8217;s, get the Z-Man. At L.C.&#8217;s, get ribs, order in a hurry, and pay with cash. <a href=\"#XXX_fnr3\" title=\"Back To Top\">&#8629;</a></li></ol></div>

Later in the year &mdash; some time after our summer vacation to the Colorado mountains &mdash; as I was looking through the photos we had of him, I realized I wasn’t giddy about hardly any of them.</p><p>There were many great snapshots of some very fond memories. But none of the images were of a quality where I wanted to print them out and frame them. They pretty much only looked good on the small screen of my iPhone.</p><p>That’s when I decided my iPhone shouldn’t bear the burden of being the best and only camera in the house.</p><p>I began <a href=\"http://shawnblanc.net/2012/11/hunting-for-the-best-mirrorless-camera/\">researching mirrorless cameras</a> looking for a rig I could easily take with me anywhere I went, and which cost under $1,000. I wanted the camera to have an Auto mode so I could just point and shoot if I wanted to, or so I could hand it to a family member to point and shoot with. But it also needed to have good manual modes so I could learn and grow into the manual controls as I learned more about the technical details of photography.</p><p>The rig I chose was the new <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0096WDMGC/ref=nosim&amp;tag=shabla-20\">Olympus E-PL5</a> and the world-famous <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B002IKLJVE/ref=nosim&amp;tag=shabla-20\">Panasonic 20mm f/1.7</a> pancake lens.</p><p><a href=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/epl5-hero-2.jpg\"><img class=\"leftb\" src=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/epl5-hero-2.jpg\" width=\"460\" title=\"The Olympus E-PL5\" alt=\"The Olympus E-PL5\" /></a></p><p><a href=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/epl5-hero-3.jpg\"><img class=\"leftb\" src=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/epl5-hero-3.jpg\" width=\"460\" title=\"The Olympus E-PL5\" alt=\"The Olympus E-PL5\" /></a></p><p>After 6 months shooting with the E-PL5, I continue to be impressed and pleased by the quality of the images this small and sturdy rig is capable of.</p><p><em>(Note: Click the images to zoom them.)</em></p><p><a href=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/bandbcafe.jpg\"><img class=\"leftb\" src=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/bandbcafe.jpg\" width=\"460\" title=\"The B and B Cafe in Castle Rock, CO\" alt=\"The B and B Cafe in Castle Rock, CO\" /></a></p><p>Though my skill behind the lens still leaves much to be desired, my slow-growing collection of great images has long since proven to me that getting a nice camera was a good idea. The photographs I’ve taken with the E-PL5 juxtapose themselves against my iPhone pics because the images from the E-PL5 are ones which look <em>better</em> when on a big screen or printed out and framed.</p><p>This isn’t something exclusive to the E-PL5, of course. Any decent camera with good sensor and quality glass will take some great shots. At $900 &mdash; the price for the E-PL5 body and the Panasonic 20mm f/1.7 lens &mdash; I would be upset if this rig <em>did’t</em> produce some great images.</p><p><a href=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/noah-christmas.jpg\"><img class=\"leftb\" src=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/noah-christmas.jpg\" width=\"460\" title=\"Noah\" alt=\"Noah\" /></a></p><p><a href=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/anna-portrait.jpg\"><img class=\"leftb\" src=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/anna-portrait.jpg\" width=\"460\" title=\"Anna\" alt=\"Anna\" /></a></p><p><a href=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/siphon-coffee.jpg\"><img class=\"leftb\" src=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/siphon-coffee.jpg\" width=\"460\" title=\"Siphon Coffee\" alt=\"Siphon Coffee\" /></a></p><p>There are a few reasons I went with the E-PL5 instead of the many, many other options out there in the mirrorless category:</p><ul><li>I didn’t go with the RX-1 because its price tag is 3 times what my budget was.</li><li>I didn’t go with any of the Sony NEX line because I wanted a better lens selection and smaller camera body.</li><li>I didn’t go with the Panasonic GX-1 because I could afford a better camera if I could find one.</li></ul><p>In short, the E-PL5 was the smallest camera I could find with the best possible sensor inside and most features.</p><p>As I’ll talk more about below, this camera is basically the guts of the E-M5 put inside a smaller body with a few less pro features on the outside. And that, my friends, is why I consider the E-PL5 to be one of the best-kept secrets in the Micro Four Thirds category.</p><h4>Aside regarding the King of the M4/3 Hill, the OM-D E-M5</h4><p>I didn’t want to write a review of the E-PL5 without at least a little bit of context and experience with some of the other offerings out there. So I rented the Olympus <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0074WDDN8/ref=nosim&amp;tag=shabla-20\">OM-D E-M5</a> along with the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0058PL9QG/ref=nosim&amp;tag=shabla-20\">Olympus 45mm f/1.8 lens</a> for a few weeks.</p><p>The E-M5 is widely regarded as the best Micro Four Thirds camera out there.</p><p>When I bought the E-PL5, it was so new to the market that I could hardly find any hands-on reviews. But what made it so special is the fact that its sensor and processor are the same as what is found in the E-M5. Because of all the great reviews I’d been reading about the E-M5, I felt confident buying the E-PL5 on blind faith, trusting that it would be able to perform admirably.</p><p>I rented the E-M5 to give myself some context for how the E-PL5 compares against the best M4/3 camera out there, and also to find out for sure if I had made the right choice in getting a smaller and cheaper camera with a few less features and controls.</p><p>The most significant differences between the E-M5 and the E-PL5 are the pro-level features the former has which the latter does not. The E-M5 has a built-in electronic viewfinder, two manual dial controls, and a slightly larger hand grip. The E-M5 is also weather proof (meaning you can take it out in the rain without fear of ruining it), while the E-PL5 is not.</p><p>On the inside, the E-M5 and E-PL5 are much more similar. They have the same 16MP sensor and image processor that made the E-M5 so famous. They both have in-body image stabilization (though the E-M5 has 5-axis IBIS, while the E-PL5 uses conventional 2-axis), and they both have a dust reduction system that silently vibrates the sensor each time you turn on the camera to help “fling” any dust which may be there.</p><p>In my usage and comparisons, the two cameras produced nearly identical images. In several situations I took images with both the E-M5 and E-PL5, even switching lenses so as to try and take the exact same image with both cameras. To my eye, the shots look like they’re from the same camera.</p><p><em>Below: taken with the E-M5 and 45mm lens, 1/100sec at f/1.8, ISO 500</em><a href=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/noah-em5.jpg\"><img class=\"leftb\" src=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/noah-em5.jpg\" height=\" \" width=\"460\" title=\"Taken with E-M5 and 45mm lens\" alt=\"Taken with E-M5 and 45mm lens\" /></a></p><p><em>Below: taken with the E-PL5 and 45mm, 1/80sec at f/1.8, ISO 400</em><a href=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/noah-epl5-comparison.jpg\"><img class=\"leftb\" src=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/noah-epl5-comparison.jpg\" height=\" \" width=\"460\" title=\"Taken with the E-PL5 and 45mm lens\" alt=\"Taken with the E-PL5 and 45mm lens\" /></a></p><p><em>Below: taken with the E-M5 and 20mm, 1/60sec at f/1.7, ISO 400</em><a href=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/typewriter-em5.jpg\"><img class=\"leftb\" src=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/typewriter-em5.jpg\" height=\" \" width=\"460\" title=\"taken with the E-M5 and 20mm\" alt=\"taken with the E-M5 and 20mm\" /></a></p><p><em>Below: taken with the E-PL5 and 20mm, 1/50sec at f/1.7, ISO 400</em><a href=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/typewriter-epl5.jpg\"><img class=\"leftb\" src=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/typewriter-epl5.jpg\" height=\" \" width=\"460\" title=\"taken with the E-PL5 and 20mm lens\" alt=\"taken with the E-PL5 and 20mm lens\" /></a></p><p>In my opinion, the advantages of the E-M5 over the E-PL5 are almost entirely in the bells and whistles and not in the end-product capabilities. For photographers who have used bigger DSLR rigs, or who really want a viewfinder, then the E-M5 will probably feel more comfortable. But for everyone else, the $400 you’ll save by buying the E-PL5 instead of the E-M5 is probably better spent on a nice lens.</p><h3>E-PL5 Overview</h3><p>With the Panasonic pancake lens attached, the E-PL5 is small enough to fit in my coat pocket, the glove box in my Jeep, or alongside my MacBook Air, iPad, and Moleskine inside my extra small Timbuk2 bag.</p><p>The build quality is excellent. The camera is sturdy but not heavy, weighing just 1 pound with the 20mm pancake lens and wrist strap attached (body only, the E-PL5 weighs a mere 12 ounces). And because of its smaller size and lack of a viewfinder, the E-PL5 doesn’t look too intimidating.</p><p>The humble appearance of the E-PL5 is one of its best features. With it I feel less like a “wannabe pro photographer” and more like a “casual photography enthusiast” when I have the camera out in public.</p><p>My goal with the E-PL5 wasn’t to get my toe in the waters of professional photography. I just wanted a high-quality camera nearby for when I would have otherwise reached for my iPhone.</p><p>Having a non-giant camera makes it far more likely that I will take it with me when I’m leaving the house and to actually use it while I’m out. Coat-pocketable means “it will get used” in this case. And isn’t that the whole point?</p><h4>Sans Viewfinder</h4><p>The E-PL5 does not have a built-in electronic viewfinder (EVF) &mdash; to frame your shots, you use the view screen.</p><p>For some people, this may be a deal breaker. What’s nice about having a viewfinder is that you can <a href=\"http://hypertext.net/2013/02/davidson-rx1\">hide behind it</a>, and also you can steady your camera a bit better by holding it up to your face. But in my few weeks with the E-M5 (which does have a viewfinder), I found myself using the E-M5′s view screen instead of its built-in EVF.</p><p>For me, sacrificing a viewfinder is worth the tradeoff because it means having a smaller camera body. However, since the E-PL5 supports add-ons via its hotshoe connection, you could buy the Olympus <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B003A4GZUC/ref=nosim&amp;tag=shabla-20\">VF2</a> or <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B005FQSXFI/ref=nosim&amp;tag=shabla-20\">VF3</a>.</p><h4>The View Screen</h4><p>On the back of the camera is a 3-inch, tilting, LCD touch screen.</p><p>You can tap to focus, tap to adjust color settings, and more. There is a dial control “d-pad” placed just to the right of the screen which also evokes the menu and is used to navigate through all the levels of settings.</p><p>The screen isn’t stationary either &mdash; it flips out and can tilt.</p><p><a href=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/epl5-flip-out-view-screen.jpg\"><img class=\"leftb\" src=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/epl5-flip-out-view-screen.jpg\" width=\"460\" title=\"The Flip-out view screen on the E-PL5\" alt=\"The Flip-out view screen on the E-PL5\" /></a></p><p>I was worried about the fragility of the flip-out screen. But to my relief, the hinges are incredibly sturdy and well built. I am often taking shots with the camera held down near my waist, and it’s easy to just flip the screen up 90 degrees and look down into the view screen. In short, it moves easily, holds in place just fine, and is a considerably useful feature.</p><p>The quality of the display itself is excellent as well. Though Olympus does not say what the actual screen resolution is, they do say it’s a 3-inch diagonal screen with a 16:9 aspect of approximately 460,000 dots. If “dots” means “pixels,” then the view screen would have a resolution somewhere in the neighborhood of 904×507 pixels with a PPI density of 345. Now, the view screen is certainly nice, but it’s not <em>that</em> nice.</p><p>On Twitter, Milosz Bolechowski <a href=\"https://twitter.com/meewosh/status/319200781247082496\">pointed out</a> that the “dots” are likely <a href=\"https://twitter.com/meewosh/status/319201065683779584\">referring to</a> each of the 3 RBG dots in a single pixel. Which I agree is most likely the case. Meaning the 460,000 or so dots in the view screen equal approximately 153,333 pixels.</p><p>Thus, the view screen most likely has a resolution of 533×294 with a PPI density of 200.</p><p>To protect the screen, I bought one of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B003U2YCZE/ref=nosim&amp;tag=shabla-20\">these plastic screen covers</a>. It’s sized for the NEX cameras, but it’s a near-perfect fit for the E-PL5 as well &mdash; I never even notice that it’s there. Highly recommended.</p><h4>The Grip</h4><p>The E-PL5 comes with a small, removable hand grip. Without the grip attached, the camera has a bit more of a classic look to it, akin to the thin and simple rangefinder bodies of old.</p><p>But I can’t imagine <em>not</em> wanting to attach the grip. It adds hardly any size and makes the E-PL5 significantly easier to hold with one hand. When attached, the grip stays quite secure, as if it were built in as part of the camera body from the start.</p><h4>Manual Dials and Shooting in Manual Mode</h4><p>As expected, the E-PL5 has several different shooting modes: Auto, Program, Aperture-Priority, Shutter-Priority, and Manual. As well as Movie, Scene, and Art modes.</p><p>I mostly shoot in Aperture-Priority mode and am happy to let the camera pick the shutter speed for me in order to get the right exposure.</p><p>The Movie and Art modes allow you to choose an artsy filter to apply to your movie or photograph &mdash; it’s like having Instagram built in to your camera. I’ve never used these in real life (I prefer to edit my images in <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/adobe-photoshop-lightroom-4/id506734677?mt=12&amp;partnerId=30&amp;siteID=jVL634u150Y\">Lightroom 4</a>), but here are two sample shots I took for this review: one using the <a href=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/root-beer-pin-hole.jpg\">Pin Hole</a> filter and one using the <a href=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/root-beer-grainy-film.jpg\">Grainy Film</a> filter. Both of these shots are the out of camera JPGs, but the E-PL5′s in-camera filters are applied to the RAW image file as well, so I could take remove them in Lightroom if I wanted.</p><p>What I most wish the E-PL5 had was a few dedicated manual dial controls. When shooting in Aperture-Priority Mode, Manual, or the like, having a few dials that give you quick and instant access to adjust the aperture, shutter, and/or ISO are very nice. The E-M5 had these dials and I found myself using them all the time.</p><p>On the E-PL5, when I’m shooting in Aperture-Priority mode (which is the most common setting for me), adjusting the aperture number requires a tap “up” on the menu D-Pad to highlight the aperture setting, and then a tap left or right in order to increase or decrease the aperture. Moreover, the D-Pad is pretty small (smaller than a Dime) and therefore is not easy to navigate. This is not nearly as nice or fast as having a dial that you can click left or right without having to lean back and look at the camera for a few seconds.</p><h4>Battery Life</h4><p>Battery life is absolutely fantastic. On the very first charge, after 4 days of shooting and about 500 images, it was low on battery. After that first charge I didn’t need to charge the battery for over 2.5 weeks, and that was with near daily use.</p><p>The camera seems to go forever. The battery is one thing I’ve never once worried about, nor have I been out shooting and had the battery die on me. If I know I’ll be using the camera a lot over the weekend or something then I’ll charge it up ahead of time.</p><p>The only thing I don’t like about the battery is that it comes with its own charging station. This means when traveling there is one more cable and trinket to pack. I’d prefer to be able to charge the battery by plugging a USB cable into the camera itself.</p><h4>Low-Light Performance</h4><p>For what I know about low light performance, the E-PL5 performs wonderfully. Low-light images have very little noise, and can generally be doctored just fine in Lightroom.</p><p>With the default white balance settings, I’ve noticed that images straight out of the camera tend to have a bit of a warm tone to them, giving portraits a bit more orange-colored skin tone than is to my liking. This can be adjusted in the camera’s white balance settings to have a more “cool” tint to them, or the orange skin can be easily fixed in Lightroom.</p><p>The biggest downside of low light shooting is not the image quality, but the autofocus. The 20mm lens already has a tendency to hunt at times, and in low light situations you can sometimes wait 2 or 3 seconds for the autofocus to find a contrast point and snap the image.</p><p>There have only been a few low-light situations where the lighting was so dark that I was frustrated with the E-PL5′s ability to focus and snap a shot. One of those times was when we all went out to dinner for my dad’s 60th birthday. We were at a fancy steak restaurant where the lighting was extremely dim.</p><p>The E-PL5 comes with a flash that attaches via the hotshoe port on top, but I’ve never used it. In a setting like the steak restaurant, using the flash would have been rude; in most other settings the flash isn’t even necessary.</p><p>For most low-light settings (such as indoors in the evening), the camera does great with very little noise in the images.</p><h4>Speed</h4><ul><li><p><strong>Startup speed:</strong> From the time I press the power button to when the camera is ready to snap a picture, it’s less than 2 seconds.</p><p>The E-PL5 is usually up and ready to go before I even have the lens cap off. Which means if the Olympus is nearby, it’s actually faster for me to grab it, turn it on, and snap a shot than it is for me to pull my iPhone out of my pocket and launch the Camera app. Even when racing against the Lock Screen Camera app shortcut, the E-PL5 wins by about 1 second.</p></li><li><p><strong>Shot-to-shot speed:</strong> If you want to manually shoot several shots in succession, in decent indoor light or better, the the E-PL5 takes just 1.5 seconds to autofocus, snap a picture, write to the card, and then be ready to focus again.</p></li><li><p><strong>Autofocus speed:</strong> The Olympus is well known for its fast autofocus. As I mention below in the section on lenses, the autofocus on the Olympus 45mm lens is so fast it seems instantaneous; with the Panasonic 20mm the autofocus is a bit slower.</p><p>You can hold the shutter button halfway down to have the camera autofocus on either an area within the viewfinder grid, or the camera can automatically find a face and focus on the nearest eyeball. Then, pressing the shutter button all the way down snaps the image. But, if you want the camera to snap a photo as soon as it’s grabbed focus, you can press the shutter button all the way down right away and it will snap as soon as it has focus. In decent light, this is almost instantaneously.</p><p>Moreover, you can focus and shoot an image using the touchscreen. You can set the camera to tap to focus on any area of the screen, but you can also configure it to snap the shot as soon as it locks the focus.</p><p>Using the E-PL5′s touchscreen reminds me a lot of using the camera on my iPhone. The camera’s software is responsive, clever, and useful. Well done, Olympus.</p></li></ul><h4>Camera Straps</h4><p>The stock camera strap is lame. It’s not detachable, nor is it long enough to let the camera rest at a comfortable distance when over one shoulder and under my other arm.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.dsptch.com\">DSPTCH</a> makes some pretty awesome shoulder straps. I ordered one from them that I really like, but after a couple months of use I felt like I didn’t always want a shoulder strap attached. In fact, I often don’t &mdash; most of the time the camera is in my bag or in my jacket pocket and I’m not walking around with it around my shoulder. (Of course, now that summer is approaching, that may change.)</p><p>So I ordered yet another strap. This time a <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/shawnblanc/8576113368/\">small leather wrist strap</a> from <a href=\"http://www.gordyscamerastraps.com\">Gordy’s</a>. The wrist strap is small enough to not be in the way when just grabbing the camera, and I think it looks great.</p><p>I probably should have ordered one of DSPTCH’s <a href=\"http://www.dsptch.com/collections/wrist\">wrist straps</a> which use the same clip that their shoulder straps use. This would have made it easy for me to swap out the shoulder strap and the wrist strap depending on my need. But the leather straps at Gordy’s were too cool to pass by. <em>Whatchagonnado?</em></p><p><a href=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/gordy-camera-strap.jpg\"><img class=\"leftb\" src=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/gordy-camera-strap.jpg\" width=\"460\" title=\"One of Gordy's Camera Straps\" alt=\"One of Gordy's leather camera straps\" /></a></p><h3>Lenses</h3><p>A Micro Four Thirds sensor has a crop ratio of 1/2. So, for example, a 20mm lens on a M4/3 rig is actually a 40mm equivalent when compared to a full-frame sensor. Which is why shooting with the 20mm as my daily glass is not as fishy as it sounds, because it’s just a bit bigger than shooting with a good ole 35mm lens.</p><p>I’ve used 3 of the most popular Micro Four Thirds lenses:</p><ul><li><p><strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B002IKLJVE/ref=nosim&amp;tag=shabla-20\">Panasonic 20/1.7 lens:</a></strong> This is the lens attached to my rig. Though this lens is certainly no slouch, perhaps it’s greatest advantage compared to the lenses below is its size. The pancake lens looks great on the small body of the E-PL5 and affords the rig to easily fit in coat pockets, etc.</p><p>The disadvantages of the 20mm is that because of its compact size it doesn’t grab quite as high-quality images as a “regular sized” lens. But, at least to my eyes, the difference is barely noticeable and the advantages in both size and cost far outweigh the very slight disadvantages in image quality.</p><p>Unless you know that you want a different lens, this is the one I would start with.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0055N2L22/ref=nosim&amp;tag=shabla-20\">Panasonic 25/1.4 lens:</a></strong> Compared to the 20mm pancake, this 25mm produces higher quality images, has faster autofocus, and is capable of a better and creamier depth of field. But it’s also a larger piece of glass and it costs $150 more (so, obviously it had better take better images).</p><p>Though this is my favorite lens of the 3 I’ve tried, the size turned me off to the 25mm as my daily glass &mdash; it is too big to allow the camera to easily fit in my coat pocket. And the focal length is too similar to the 20mm to justify owning both lenses (as much as I would love to own them both). So I returned the 25mm and kept the 20mm.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0058PL9QG/ref=nosim&amp;tag=shabla-20\">Olympus 45/1.8 lens:</a></strong> This is the portrait lens of the Micro Four Thirds world. One thing Olympus lenses are known for is their lightning-fast auto focusing, and it’s true. This lens hunts far less than the 20mm, and its images are so clear and crisp.</p><p>If and when I decide to buy a second lens, it will likely be the 45mm. Compared to the 20mm pancake, the 45mm is not nearly as compact or attractive (seriously, a silver lens on a black body?). If the 45mm were my only lens, I know I’d be using the E-PL5 less often.</p></li></ul><h3>Editing Workflow</h3><p>So far my editing workflow is simple and straightforward. I plug my camera’s SD card into my MacBook Air, import the photos into Lightroom 4, and then make some minor edits using one of VSCO’s Film packs.</p><p>During <a href=\"http://5by5.tv/bb/85\">one of our B&amp;B shows</a>, my pal Ben Brooks told me how he uses a 0-based rating system which I’ve also adopted. When going through the latest lot of imported photos, I flag all the blurry, crappy, or duplicate images for deletion. Then I go through and rate what I think are the best photos with a 3-, 4-, or 5-star rating.</p><p>I then upload my favorites to <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/shawnblanc/\">my Flickr account</a>. We’ve had a few printed and framed so far, and I think it’s just great to have my own pictures of my own family up and around in my home. Printing through <a href=\"http://www.shutterfly.com\">Shutterfly</a> is cheap and easy enough that with a few easy-swap frames, we can change out our 8×10 prints pretty much as often as we like.</p><p>Perhaps a more-detailed writeup on this subject is in order because there are a few things about my editing workflow that I’m still not happy with. Primarily:</p><ul><li>Archiving old images &mdash; right now they’re all on my MacBook Air and quickly encroaching on my disk space.</li><li>Posting my favorite images &mdash; while Flickr is nice, I’d like a spot that’s a little bit more my own. I’ve been considering setting up my own image portfolio website just so I can have a spot that encourages more regular posting of images. </li></ul><h3>Real-Life Usage</h3><p>One of the most rewarding parts of photography is when, after a lot of shooting, I plug the card into my MacBook Air, import all the most-recent photos, and begin to look them over. If there are 1 or 2 (or even 3) shots that turned out awesome, then all the energy that went into capturing those few photographs was worth it.</p><p>When I find those few great images from the batch, I lean back in my chair. Looking at one of them, I take a deep breath and smile. Then I call my wife to come downstairs and check out the latest photos, and we talk about what it is that we like about it. Maybe it’s an image of our son, Noah, that captured one of his many funny faces. Maybe it’s a shot that’s framed just right, or has light that’s doing some incredible thing.</p><p>I’m still learning, and so right now maybe 1 in 500 shots turn out that good. But when they do, I love it that the quality can be there to match the times when the composition is just right. When I compare moments like that with the times I’ve gone through my iPhone’s photo library, though I have lots of pictures, they are all more like snapshots and not photographs (if that makes sense).</p><p>Shots like this are the rare ones which justify my camera purchase a hundred times over.</p><p><a href=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/anna-noah-reading.jpg\"><img class=\"leftb\" src=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/anna-noah-reading.jpg\" width=\"460\" title=\"Anna and Noah reading\" alt=\"Anna and Noah reading\" /></a></p><p>Images like these are, of course, not going to be exclusive to the E-PL5. There are many other amazing cameras out there. For me, going with a small rig instead of a large DSLR (or even a medium-sized NEX) means I’m much more likely to actually take the camera with me.</p><p>And that is the entire point: The E-PL5 is an extremely capable and delightfully portable camera.</p>" "http://shawnblanc.net/2013/04/camera-review-olympus-e-pl5/" (20830 52004) new 1 nil nil ((title nil "✚ Camera Review: The Olympus E-PL5") (link nil "http://shawnblanc.net/2013/04/camera-review-olympus-e-pl5/") (comments nil "http://shawnblanc.net/2013/04/camera-review-olympus-e-pl5/#comments") (pubDate nil "Fri, 05 Apr 2013 13:01:24 +0000") (dc:creator nil "Shawn Blanc") (category nil "Articles") (category nil "Photography") (category nil "Reviews") (guid ((isPermaLink .

Later in the year &mdash; some time after our summer vacation to the Colorado mountains &mdash; as I was looking through the photos we had of him, I realized I wasn&#8217;t giddy about hardly any of them.</p><p>There were many great snapshots of some very fond memories. But none of the images were of a quality where I wanted to print them out and frame them. They pretty much only looked good on the small screen of my iPhone.</p><p>That&#8217;s when I decided my iPhone shouldn&#8217;t bear the burden of being the best and only camera in the house.</p><p>I began <a href=\"http://shawnblanc.net/2012/11/hunting-for-the-best-mirrorless-camera/\">researching mirrorless cameras</a> looking for a rig I could easily take with me anywhere I went, and which cost under $1,000. I wanted the camera to have an Auto mode so I could just point and shoot if I wanted to, or so I could hand it to a family member to point and shoot with. But it also needed to have good manual modes so I could learn and grow into the manual controls as I learned more about the technical details of photography.</p><p>The rig I chose was the new <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0096WDMGC/ref=nosim&amp;tag=shabla-20\">Olympus E-PL5</a> and the world-famous <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B002IKLJVE/ref=nosim&amp;tag=shabla-20\">Panasonic 20mm f/1.7</a> pancake lens.</p><p><a href=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/epl5-hero-2.jpg\"><img class=\"leftb\" src=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/epl5-hero-2.jpg\" width=\"460\" title=\"The Olympus E-PL5\" alt=\"The Olympus E-PL5\" /></a></p><p><a href=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/epl5-hero-3.jpg\"><img class=\"leftb\" src=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/epl5-hero-3.jpg\" width=\"460\" title=\"The Olympus E-PL5\" alt=\"The Olympus E-PL5\" /></a></p><p>After 6 months shooting with the E-PL5, I continue to be impressed and pleased by the quality of the images this small and sturdy rig is capable of.</p><p><em>(Note: Click the images to zoom them.)</em></p><p><a href=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/bandbcafe.jpg\"><img class=\"leftb\" src=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/bandbcafe.jpg\" width=\"460\" title=\"The B and B Cafe in Castle Rock, CO\" alt=\"The B and B Cafe in Castle Rock, CO\" /></a></p><p>Though my skill behind the lens still leaves much to be desired, my slow-growing collection of great images has long since proven to me that getting a nice camera was a good idea. The photographs I&#8217;ve taken with the E-PL5 juxtapose themselves against my iPhone pics because the images from the E-PL5 are ones which look <em>better</em> when on a big screen or printed out and framed.</p><p>This isn&#8217;t something exclusive to the E-PL5, of course. Any decent camera with good sensor and quality glass will take some great shots. At $900 &mdash; the price for the E-PL5 body and the Panasonic 20mm f/1.7 lens &mdash; I would be upset if this rig <em>did&#8217;t</em> produce some great images.</p><p><a href=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/noah-christmas.jpg\"><img class=\"leftb\" src=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/noah-christmas.jpg\" width=\"460\" title=\"Noah\" alt=\"Noah\" /></a></p><p><a href=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/anna-portrait.jpg\"><img class=\"leftb\" src=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/anna-portrait.jpg\" width=\"460\" title=\"Anna\" alt=\"Anna\" /></a></p><p><a href=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/siphon-coffee.jpg\"><img class=\"leftb\" src=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/siphon-coffee.jpg\" width=\"460\" title=\"Siphon Coffee\" alt=\"Siphon Coffee\" /></a></p><p>There are a few reasons I went with the E-PL5 instead of the many, many other options out there in the mirrorless category:</p><ul><li>I didn&#8217;t go with the RX-1 because its price tag is 3 times what my budget was.</li><li>I didn&#8217;t go with any of the Sony NEX line because I wanted a better lens selection and smaller camera body.</li><li>I didn&#8217;t go with the Panasonic GX-1 because I could afford a better camera if I could find one.</li></ul><p>In short, the E-PL5 was the smallest camera I could find with the best possible sensor inside and most features.</p><p>As I&#8217;ll talk more about below, this camera is basically the guts of the E-M5 put inside a smaller body with a few less pro features on the outside. And that, my friends, is why I consider the E-PL5 to be one of the best-kept secrets in the Micro Four Thirds category.</p><h4>Aside regarding the King of the M4/3 Hill, the OM-D E-M5</h4><p>I didn&#8217;t want to write a review of the E-PL5 without at least a little bit of context and experience with some of the other offerings out there. So I rented the Olympus <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0074WDDN8/ref=nosim&amp;tag=shabla-20\">OM-D E-M5</a> along with the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0058PL9QG/ref=nosim&amp;tag=shabla-20\">Olympus 45mm f/1.8 lens</a> for a few weeks.</p><p>The E-M5 is widely regarded as the best Micro Four Thirds camera out there.</p><p>When I bought the E-PL5, it was so new to the market that I could hardly find any hands-on reviews. But what made it so special is the fact that its sensor and processor are the same as what is found in the E-M5. Because of all the great reviews I&#8217;d been reading about the E-M5, I felt confident buying the E-PL5 on blind faith, trusting that it would be able to perform admirably.</p><p>I rented the E-M5 to give myself some context for how the E-PL5 compares against the best M4/3 camera out there, and also to find out for sure if I had made the right choice in getting a smaller and cheaper camera with a few less features and controls.</p><p>The most significant differences between the E-M5 and the E-PL5 are the pro-level features the former has which the latter does not. The E-M5 has a built-in electronic viewfinder, two manual dial controls, and a slightly larger hand grip. The E-M5 is also weather proof (meaning you can take it out in the rain without fear of ruining it), while the E-PL5 is not.</p><p>On the inside, the E-M5 and E-PL5 are much more similar. They have the same 16MP sensor and image processor that made the E-M5 so famous. They both have in-body image stabilization (though the E-M5 has 5-axis IBIS, while the E-PL5 uses conventional 2-axis), and they both have a dust reduction system that silently vibrates the sensor each time you turn on the camera to help &#8220;fling&#8221; any dust which may be there.</p><p>In my usage and comparisons, the two cameras produced nearly identical images. In several situations I took images with both the E-M5 and E-PL5, even switching lenses so as to try and take the exact same image with both cameras. To my eye, the shots look like they&#8217;re from the same camera.</p><p><em>Below: taken with the E-M5 and 45mm lens, 1/100sec at f/1.8, ISO 500</em><a href=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/noah-em5.jpg\"><img class=\"leftb\" src=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/noah-em5.jpg\" height=\" \" width=\"460\" title=\"Taken with E-M5 and 45mm lens\" alt=\"Taken with E-M5 and 45mm lens\" /></a></p><p><em>Below: taken with the E-PL5 and 45mm, 1/80sec at f/1.8, ISO 400</em><a href=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/noah-epl5-comparison.jpg\"><img class=\"leftb\" src=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/noah-epl5-comparison.jpg\" height=\" \" width=\"460\" title=\"Taken with the E-PL5 and 45mm lens\" alt=\"Taken with the E-PL5 and 45mm lens\" /></a></p><p><em>Below: taken with the E-M5 and 20mm, 1/60sec at f/1.7, ISO 400</em><a href=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/typewriter-em5.jpg\"><img class=\"leftb\" src=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/typewriter-em5.jpg\" height=\" \" width=\"460\" title=\"taken with the E-M5 and 20mm\" alt=\"taken with the E-M5 and 20mm\" /></a></p><p><em>Below: taken with the E-PL5 and 20mm, 1/50sec at f/1.7, ISO 400</em><a href=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/typewriter-epl5.jpg\"><img class=\"leftb\" src=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/typewriter-epl5.jpg\" height=\" \" width=\"460\" title=\"taken with the E-PL5 and 20mm lens\" alt=\"taken with the E-PL5 and 20mm lens\" /></a></p><p>In my opinion, the advantages of the E-M5 over the E-PL5 are almost entirely in the bells and whistles and not in the end-product capabilities. For photographers who have used bigger DSLR rigs, or who really want a viewfinder, then the E-M5 will probably feel more comfortable. But for everyone else, the $400 you&#8217;ll save by buying the E-PL5 instead of the E-M5 is probably better spent on a nice lens.</p><h3>E-PL5 Overview</h3><p>With the Panasonic pancake lens attached, the E-PL5 is small enough to fit in my coat pocket, the glove box in my Jeep, or alongside my MacBook Air, iPad, and Moleskine inside my extra small Timbuk2 bag.</p><p>The build quality is excellent. The camera is sturdy but not heavy, weighing just 1 pound with the 20mm pancake lens and wrist strap attached (body only, the E-PL5 weighs a mere 12 ounces). And because of its smaller size and lack of a viewfinder, the E-PL5 doesn&#8217;t look too intimidating.</p><p>The humble appearance of the E-PL5 is one of its best features. With it I feel less like a &#8220;wannabe pro photographer&#8221; and more like a &#8220;casual photography enthusiast&#8221; when I have the camera out in public.</p><p>My goal with the E-PL5 wasn&#8217;t to get my toe in the waters of professional photography. I just wanted a high-quality camera nearby for when I would have otherwise reached for my iPhone.</p><p>Having a non-giant camera makes it far more likely that I will take it with me when I&#8217;m leaving the house and to actually use it while I&#8217;m out. Coat-pocketable means &#8220;it will get used&#8221; in this case. And isn&#8217;t that the whole point?</p><h4>Sans Viewfinder</h4><p>The E-PL5 does not have a built-in electronic viewfinder (EVF) &mdash; to frame your shots, you use the view screen.</p><p>For some people, this may be a deal breaker. What&#8217;s nice about having a viewfinder is that you can <a href=\"http://hypertext.net/2013/02/davidson-rx1\">hide behind it</a>, and also you can steady your camera a bit better by holding it up to your face. But in my few weeks with the E-M5 (which does have a viewfinder), I found myself using the E-M5&#8242;s view screen instead of its built-in EVF.</p><p>For me, sacrificing a viewfinder is worth the tradeoff because it means having a smaller camera body. However, since the E-PL5 supports add-ons via its hotshoe connection, you could buy the Olympus <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B003A4GZUC/ref=nosim&amp;tag=shabla-20\">VF2</a> or <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B005FQSXFI/ref=nosim&amp;tag=shabla-20\">VF3</a>.</p><h4>The View Screen</h4><p>On the back of the camera is a 3-inch, tilting, LCD touch screen.</p><p>You can tap to focus, tap to adjust color settings, and more. There is a dial control &#8220;d-pad&#8221; placed just to the right of the screen which also evokes the menu and is used to navigate through all the levels of settings.</p><p>The screen isn&#8217;t stationary either &mdash; it flips out and can tilt.</p><p><a href=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/epl5-flip-out-view-screen.jpg\"><img class=\"leftb\" src=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/epl5-flip-out-view-screen.jpg\" width=\"460\" title=\"The Flip-out view screen on the E-PL5\" alt=\"The Flip-out view screen on the E-PL5\" /></a></p><p>I was worried about the fragility of the flip-out screen. But to my relief, the hinges are incredibly sturdy and well built. I am often taking shots with the camera held down near my waist, and it&#8217;s easy to just flip the screen up 90 degrees and look down into the view screen. In short, it moves easily, holds in place just fine, and is a considerably useful feature.</p><p>The quality of the display itself is excellent as well. Though Olympus does not say what the actual screen resolution is, they do say it&#8217;s a 3-inch diagonal screen with a 16:9 aspect of approximately 460,000 dots. If &#8220;dots&#8221; means &#8220;pixels,&#8221; then the view screen would have a resolution somewhere in the neighborhood of 904&#215;507 pixels with a PPI density of 345. Now, the view screen is certainly nice, but it&#8217;s not <em>that</em> nice.</p><p>On Twitter, Milosz Bolechowski <a href=\"https://twitter.com/meewosh/status/319200781247082496\">pointed out</a> that the &#8220;dots&#8221; are likely <a href=\"https://twitter.com/meewosh/status/319201065683779584\">referring to</a> each of the 3 RBG dots in a single pixel. Which I agree is most likely the case. Meaning the 460,000 or so dots in the view screen equal approximately 153,333 pixels.</p><p>Thus, the view screen most likely has a resolution of 533&#215;294 with a PPI density of 200.</p><p>To protect the screen, I bought one of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B003U2YCZE/ref=nosim&amp;tag=shabla-20\">these plastic screen covers</a>. It&#8217;s sized for the NEX cameras, but it&#8217;s a near-perfect fit for the E-PL5 as well &mdash; I never even notice that it&#8217;s there. Highly recommended.</p><h4>The Grip</h4><p>The E-PL5 comes with a small, removable hand grip. Without the grip attached, the camera has a bit more of a classic look to it, akin to the thin and simple rangefinder bodies of old.</p><p>But I can&#8217;t imagine <em>not</em> wanting to attach the grip. It adds hardly any size and makes the E-PL5 significantly easier to hold with one hand. When attached, the grip stays quite secure, as if it were built in as part of the camera body from the start.</p><h4>Manual Dials and Shooting in Manual Mode</h4><p>As expected, the E-PL5 has several different shooting modes: Auto, Program, Aperture-Priority, Shutter-Priority, and Manual. As well as Movie, Scene, and Art modes.</p><p>I mostly shoot in Aperture-Priority mode and am happy to let the camera pick the shutter speed for me in order to get the right exposure.</p><p>The Movie and Art modes allow you to choose an artsy filter to apply to your movie or photograph &mdash; it&#8217;s like having Instagram built in to your camera. I&#8217;ve never used these in real life (I prefer to edit my images in <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/adobe-photoshop-lightroom-4/id506734677?mt=12&amp;partnerId=30&amp;siteID=jVL634u150Y\">Lightroom 4</a>), but here are two sample shots I took for this review: one using the <a href=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/root-beer-pin-hole.jpg\">Pin Hole</a> filter and one using the <a href=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/root-beer-grainy-film.jpg\">Grainy Film</a> filter. Both of these shots are the out of camera JPGs, but the E-PL5&#8242;s in-camera filters are applied to the RAW image file as well, so I could take remove them in Lightroom if I wanted.</p><p>What I most wish the E-PL5 had was a few dedicated manual dial controls. When shooting in Aperture-Priority Mode, Manual, or the like, having a few dials that give you quick and instant access to adjust the aperture, shutter, and/or ISO are very nice. The E-M5 had these dials and I found myself using them all the time.</p><p>On the E-PL5, when I&#8217;m shooting in Aperture-Priority mode (which is the most common setting for me), adjusting the aperture number requires a tap &#8220;up&#8221; on the menu D-Pad to highlight the aperture setting, and then a tap left or right in order to increase or decrease the aperture. Moreover, the D-Pad is pretty small (smaller than a Dime) and therefore is not easy to navigate. This is not nearly as nice or fast as having a dial that you can click left or right without having to lean back and look at the camera for a few seconds.</p><h4>Battery Life</h4><p>Battery life is absolutely fantastic. On the very first charge, after 4 days of shooting and about 500 images, it was low on battery. After that first charge I didn&#8217;t need to charge the battery for over 2.5 weeks, and that was with near daily use.</p><p>The camera seems to go forever. The battery is one thing I&#8217;ve never once worried about, nor have I been out shooting and had the battery die on me. If I know I&#8217;ll be using the camera a lot over the weekend or something then I&#8217;ll charge it up ahead of time.</p><p>The only thing I don&#8217;t like about the battery is that it comes with its own charging station. This means when traveling there is one more cable and trinket to pack. I&#8217;d prefer to be able to charge the battery by plugging a USB cable into the camera itself.</p><h4>Low-Light Performance</h4><p>For what I know about low light performance, the E-PL5 performs wonderfully. Low-light images have very little noise, and can generally be doctored just fine in Lightroom.</p><p>With the default white balance settings, I&#8217;ve noticed that images straight out of the camera tend to have a bit of a warm tone to them, giving portraits a bit more orange-colored skin tone than is to my liking. This can be adjusted in the camera&#8217;s white balance settings to have a more &#8220;cool&#8221; tint to them, or the orange skin can be easily fixed in Lightroom.</p><p>The biggest downside of low light shooting is not the image quality, but the autofocus. The 20mm lens already has a tendency to hunt at times, and in low light situations you can sometimes wait 2 or 3 seconds for the autofocus to find a contrast point and snap the image.</p><p>There have only been a few low-light situations where the lighting was so dark that I was frustrated with the E-PL5&#8242;s ability to focus and snap a shot. One of those times was when we all went out to dinner for my dad&#8217;s 60th birthday. We were at a fancy steak restaurant where the lighting was extremely dim.</p><p>The E-PL5 comes with a flash that attaches via the hotshoe port on top, but I&#8217;ve never used it. In a setting like the steak restaurant, using the flash would have been rude; in most other settings the flash isn&#8217;t even necessary.</p><p>For most low-light settings (such as indoors in the evening), the camera does great with very little noise in the images.</p><h4>Speed</h4><ul><li><p><strong>Startup speed:</strong> From the time I press the power button to when the camera is ready to snap a picture, it&#8217;s less than 2 seconds.</p><p>The E-PL5 is usually up and ready to go before I even have the lens cap off. Which means if the Olympus is nearby, it&#8217;s actually faster for me to grab it, turn it on, and snap a shot than it is for me to pull my iPhone out of my pocket and launch the Camera app. Even when racing against the Lock Screen Camera app shortcut, the E-PL5 wins by about 1 second.</p></li><li><p><strong>Shot-to-shot speed:</strong> If you want to manually shoot several shots in succession, in decent indoor light or better, the the E-PL5 takes just 1.5 seconds to autofocus, snap a picture, write to the card, and then be ready to focus again.</p></li><li><p><strong>Autofocus speed:</strong> The Olympus is well known for its fast autofocus. As I mention below in the section on lenses, the autofocus on the Olympus 45mm lens is so fast it seems instantaneous; with the Panasonic 20mm the autofocus is a bit slower.</p><p>You can hold the shutter button halfway down to have the camera autofocus on either an area within the viewfinder grid, or the camera can automatically find a face and focus on the nearest eyeball. Then, pressing the shutter button all the way down snaps the image. But, if you want the camera to snap a photo as soon as it&#8217;s grabbed focus, you can press the shutter button all the way down right away and it will snap as soon as it has focus. In decent light, this is almost instantaneously.</p><p>Moreover, you can focus and shoot an image using the touchscreen. You can set the camera to tap to focus on any area of the screen, but you can also configure it to snap the shot as soon as it locks the focus.</p><p>Using the E-PL5&#8242;s touchscreen reminds me a lot of using the camera on my iPhone. The camera&#8217;s software is responsive, clever, and useful. Well done, Olympus.</p></li></ul><h4>Camera Straps</h4><p>The stock camera strap is lame. It&#8217;s not detachable, nor is it long enough to let the camera rest at a comfortable distance when over one shoulder and under my other arm.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.dsptch.com\">DSPTCH</a> makes some pretty awesome shoulder straps. I ordered one from them that I really like, but after a couple months of use I felt like I didn&#8217;t always want a shoulder strap attached. In fact, I often don&#8217;t &mdash; most of the time the camera is in my bag or in my jacket pocket and I&#8217;m not walking around with it around my shoulder. (Of course, now that summer is approaching, that may change.)</p><p>So I ordered yet another strap. This time a <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/shawnblanc/8576113368/\">small leather wrist strap</a> from <a href=\"http://www.gordyscamerastraps.com\">Gordy&#8217;s</a>. The wrist strap is small enough to not be in the way when just grabbing the camera, and I think it looks great.</p><p>I probably should have ordered one of DSPTCH&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.dsptch.com/collections/wrist\">wrist straps</a> which use the same clip that their shoulder straps use. This would have made it easy for me to swap out the shoulder strap and the wrist strap depending on my need. But the leather straps at Gordy&#8217;s were too cool to pass by. <em>Whatchagonnado?</em></p><p><a href=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/gordy-camera-strap.jpg\"><img class=\"leftb\" src=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/gordy-camera-strap.jpg\" width=\"460\" title=\"One of Gordy's Camera Straps\" alt=\"One of Gordy's leather camera straps\" /></a></p><h3>Lenses</h3><p>A Micro Four Thirds sensor has a crop ratio of 1/2. So, for example, a 20mm lens on a M4/3 rig is actually a 40mm equivalent when compared to a full-frame sensor. Which is why shooting with the 20mm as my daily glass is not as fishy as it sounds, because it&#8217;s just a bit bigger than shooting with a good ole 35mm lens.</p><p>I&#8217;ve used 3 of the most popular Micro Four Thirds lenses:</p><ul><li><p><strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B002IKLJVE/ref=nosim&amp;tag=shabla-20\">Panasonic 20/1.7 lens:</a></strong> This is the lens attached to my rig. Though this lens is certainly no slouch, perhaps it&#8217;s greatest advantage compared to the lenses below is its size. The pancake lens looks great on the small body of the E-PL5 and affords the rig to easily fit in coat pockets, etc.</p><p>The disadvantages of the 20mm is that because of its compact size it doesn&#8217;t grab quite as high-quality images as a &#8220;regular sized&#8221; lens. But, at least to my eyes, the difference is barely noticeable and the advantages in both size and cost far outweigh the very slight disadvantages in image quality.</p><p>Unless you know that you want a different lens, this is the one I would start with.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0055N2L22/ref=nosim&amp;tag=shabla-20\">Panasonic 25/1.4 lens:</a></strong> Compared to the 20mm pancake, this 25mm produces higher quality images, has faster autofocus, and is capable of a better and creamier depth of field. But it&#8217;s also a larger piece of glass and it costs $150 more (so, obviously it had better take better images).</p><p>Though this is my favorite lens of the 3 I&#8217;ve tried, the size turned me off to the 25mm as my daily glass &mdash; it is too big to allow the camera to easily fit in my coat pocket. And the focal length is too similar to the 20mm to justify owning both lenses (as much as I would love to own them both). So I returned the 25mm and kept the 20mm.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0058PL9QG/ref=nosim&amp;tag=shabla-20\">Olympus 45/1.8 lens:</a></strong> This is the portrait lens of the Micro Four Thirds world. One thing Olympus lenses are known for is their lightning-fast auto focusing, and it&#8217;s true. This lens hunts far less than the 20mm, and its images are so clear and crisp.</p><p>If and when I decide to buy a second lens, it will likely be the 45mm. Compared to the 20mm pancake, the 45mm is not nearly as compact or attractive (seriously, a silver lens on a black body?). If the 45mm were my only lens, I know I&#8217;d be using the E-PL5 less often.</p></li></ul><h3>Editing Workflow</h3><p>So far my editing workflow is simple and straightforward. I plug my camera&#8217;s SD card into my MacBook Air, import the photos into Lightroom 4, and then make some minor edits using one of VSCO&#8217;s Film packs.</p><p>During <a href=\"http://5by5.tv/bb/85\">one of our B&amp;B shows</a>, my pal Ben Brooks told me how he uses a 0-based rating system which I&#8217;ve also adopted. When going through the latest lot of imported photos, I flag all the blurry, crappy, or duplicate images for deletion. Then I go through and rate what I think are the best photos with a 3-, 4-, or 5-star rating.</p><p>I then upload my favorites to <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/shawnblanc/\">my Flickr account</a>. We&#8217;ve had a few printed and framed so far, and I think it&#8217;s just great to have my own pictures of my own family up and around in my home. Printing through <a href=\"http://www.shutterfly.com\">Shutterfly</a> is cheap and easy enough that with a few easy-swap frames, we can change out our 8&#215;10 prints pretty much as often as we like.</p><p>Perhaps a more-detailed writeup on this subject is in order because there are a few things about my editing workflow that I&#8217;m still not happy with. Primarily:</p><ul><li>Archiving old images &mdash; right now they&#8217;re all on my MacBook Air and quickly encroaching on my disk space.</li><li>Posting my favorite images &mdash; while Flickr is nice, I&#8217;d like a spot that&#8217;s a little bit more my own. I&#8217;ve been considering setting up my own image portfolio website just so I can have a spot that encourages more regular posting of images. </li></ul><h3>Real-Life Usage</h3><p>One of the most rewarding parts of photography is when, after a lot of shooting, I plug the card into my MacBook Air, import all the most-recent photos, and begin to look them over. If there are 1 or 2 (or even 3) shots that turned out awesome, then all the energy that went into capturing those few photographs was worth it.</p><p>When I find those few great images from the batch, I lean back in my chair. Looking at one of them, I take a deep breath and smile. Then I call my wife to come downstairs and check out the latest photos, and we talk about what it is that we like about it. Maybe it&#8217;s an image of our son, Noah, that captured one of his many funny faces. Maybe it&#8217;s a shot that&#8217;s framed just right, or has light that&#8217;s doing some incredible thing.</p><p>I&#8217;m still learning, and so right now maybe 1 in 500 shots turn out that good. But when they do, I love it that the quality can be there to match the times when the composition is just right. When I compare moments like that with the times I&#8217;ve gone through my iPhone&#8217;s photo library, though I have lots of pictures, they are all more like snapshots and not photographs (if that makes sense).</p><p>Shots like this are the rare ones which justify my camera purchase a hundred times over.</p><p><a href=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/anna-noah-reading.jpg\"><img class=\"leftb\" src=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/anna-noah-reading.jpg\" width=\"460\" title=\"Anna and Noah reading\" alt=\"Anna and Noah reading\" /></a></p><p>Images like these are, of course, not going to be exclusive to the E-PL5. There are many other amazing cameras out there. For me, going with a small rig instead of a large DSLR (or even a medium-sized NEX) means I&#8217;m much more likely to actually take the camera with me.</p><p>And that is the entire point: The E-PL5 is an extremely capable and delightfully portable camera.</p>

Who are you, what do you do, etc…?</h4><p>I’m Patrick Welker from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin\">Berlin, Germany</a>. I live and work together with my brilliant girlfriend Maria in a 689 ft² (for the metric reader: 64 m²) apartment.</p><p>In our living room slash office we’re both working as freelancers. She’s a 3D artist and I do graphic and web design whenever there’s an occasional job for me.</p><p>I’m also a part-time student. My fields of study are English and German. Prior to that I was an audio engineer. Since I’d have to relocate and leave my girlfriend behind to stay in business I decided to listen to my heart which resulted in me staying in the city and starting to study “something which involves reading and writing”.</p><p>I let my inner geek out at <a href=\"http://rocketink.net\">RocketINK</a> where I write about how I tweak my Mac. Beside that being my number one topic, I have plans to write some more personal and in-depth pieces.</p><h4>2. What is your current setup?</h4><p><img class=\"leftb\" src=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/patrick-welker-mac-setup.jpg\" width=\"460\" title=\"Patrick Welker Desk Overview\" alt=\"Patrick Welker Desk Overview\" /></p><p><img class=\"leftb\" src=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/patrick-welker-displays.jpg\" height=\" \" width=\"460\" title=\"Patrick Welker Displays\" alt=\"Patrick Welker Displays\" /></p><p>Almost all my gear is placed on a large 15-year-old desk. I don’t know the exact model but when looking at the construction I guess it is a safe bet to say that its origin is a Swedish furniture store (hint: four-letter word, all caps).</p><p>My main machine is a 2x 2.8 GHz Quad-Core Xeon Mac Pro with 10GB of RAM, and it is connected to two 24-inch Dell displays (model: 2405FPW) which give me enough space to toy around with. The first hard drive bay with the operation system is a 160GB SSD from Intel, the other three bays carry bigger regular hard disks.</p><p>I’m a die-hard fan of the wired Apple aluminum keyboard. This particular one is the English version, more specific: the international one with a larger return key and some other minor differences. Oddly enough it isn’t listed in the Apple Store anymore. Furthermore I also own a Magic Trackpad which is placed to the right of the keyboard along with a Magic Mouse. I switch frequently between the mouse and the trackpad. If I feel that my wrist is overstrained I throw my mouse into the drawer for the rest of the day and use the trackpad. Apart from this being my regular setup, sometimes I put the trackpad on the left side of the keyboard just to scroll through documents and use my left hand a bit more.</p><p><img class=\"leftb\" src=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/patrick-welker-portables.jpg\" width=\"460\" title=\"Patrick Welker Portables\" alt=\"Patrick Welker Portables\" /></p><p>My secondary Mac is an 11-inch MacBook Air (1.6 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo, 4GB RAM) which I tend to neglect when I’m at home and not working on the Mac Pro. My 32GB third-generation iPad is now the undisputed champion of the living room and gives the MacBook a hard time finding the attention it deserves. When my iPad is resting it sits on the <a href=\"http://www.twelvesouth.com/products/compass/\">Compass</a> stand from Twelve South. The daring position of the Compass is on the left edge of my desk… and so far my iPad took the plunge “only” once. Terrible, I know.</p><p>The following are my additional gadgets for the iPad: (my girlfriend’s) <a href=\"http://the-maglus.myshopify.com/\">Maglus Stylus</a>, an old $5 pogo stylus, a black leather Smart Cover, a <a href=\"http://www.toddygear.com/shop/Toddy-Smart-Cloth/5x7/HauteToddy/Havana\">Havana smart cloth</a> from Toddy Gear and a <a href=\"http://tabuproducts.com/shop/pouch-2/\">Tabü tablet poüch</a> to give the iPad some extra protection.</p><p>When I’m on the road I use a messenger bag to carry my MacBook and iPad. I choose to go with the <a href=\"http://www.tombihn.com/laptop_bags/TB0221.html\">Ristretto from Tom Bihn</a> (link to successor) despite the high shipping costs and customs tax that are due when importing something from the United States. The bag is equipped with the fantastic <a href=\"http://www.tombihn.com/accessories/TB0505.html\">Absolute Shoulder Strap</a> and a lot of their nifty pouches and leashes. Ninety percent of the times when I leave the house I travel with my bike, and due to Tom Bihn’s <a href=\"http://www.tombihn.com/accessories/GDF-LIGHT.html\">Guardian Dual Function Light</a> I feel a lot safer when riding in the dark.</p><p>In case I’m not on one of the above mentioned devices my right hand becomes unusable for common tasks. You might think this is because I’m such a reasonable person and finally give my hand some rest, let it calm down after the heavy duty mouse and keyboard work it endured. Far from it! It’s unusable because it automatically grabs my 32GB iPhone and merges with it. I have the theory that this is a widespread disease. By the way, my phone is wrapped in a <a href=\"http://twelvesouth.com/products/bookbook_iphone5/\">BookBook case</a>. Despite the fact that I love the look and feel of a naked iPhone (after all it’s a beautiful device), for me the sheer practicality of the case justifies adding a bit of bulk.</p><p><img class=\"leftb\" src=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/patrick-welker-audio.jpg\" width=\"460\" title=\"Patrick Welker Audio Gear\" alt=\"Patrick Welker Audio Gear\" /></p><p>Now we come to the relicts of my activity as a producer. First there are my beloved <a href=\"http://dynaudioprofessional.com/bm-series/monitors/bm5a-mkii/\">Dynaudio BM5A</a> studio monitors (“monitors” is the term used by audio engineers to refer to their speakers, and, by the way, the link points to the successor). Secondly, my current Mic setup consists of an <a href=\"http://www.akg.com/site/products/powerslave,id,219,pid,219,nodeid,2,_language,EN.html\">AKG C 4000 B Studio</a> (a condenser microphone) and the <a href=\"http://www.shure.com/americas/products/microphones/sm/sm58-vocal-microphone\">Shure SM58</a> (a dynamic microphone).</p><p>Next, my midi-controller is a Novation ReMOTE 37SL and the audio interface of my choice is a <a href=\"http://www.rme-audio.de/en_products_fireface_400.php\">RME Fireface 400</a>. Finally, the last part of my audio gear are three headphones: a Philips SHP8900 for listening, an <a href=\"http://www.akg.com/site/products/powerslave,id,252,pid,252,nodeid,2,_language,EN.html\">AKG K240 Studio</a> as my personal reference monitor and a <a href=\"http://en-us.sennheiser.com/wireless-bluetooth-headset-stereo-mm-550-x-travel\">Sennheiser MM 550 Travel</a> (link to successor).</p><p>Lastly, there is just enough room for one more gadget on the desk: my old Wacom Intuos 3 (6×8).</p><p><img class=\"leftb\" src=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/patrick-welker-below.jpg\" width=\"460\" alt=\"Below the desk\" /></p><p>On the lower surface of my desktop is a <a href=\"http://www.exsys.ch/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=210&amp;language=en&amp;zenid=b3cd9a33f27d7d5cd4c985e1937ed543\">EXSYS EX-1177</a> USB 2.0 HUB with 7 ports. It is connected to my equinux TubeStick and all things USB. I label all cables going into the hub by writing the name of the gadget with a felt marker on a piece of crepe tape.</p><p>Beside my Mac a drawer unit is also placed under my desk. In the first drawer are pens and chargers to my various gadgets. Additionally, to have my Tom Bihn pouches close at hand the second drawer is solely reserved to them. On top of the drawer is a <a href=\"http://brennenstuhl.de/content.php?Produkte%2FPower+Distribution%2FSurge+Protection%2FPower+Manager+PMA+USB+15.000+A&amp;seite=shop/produkte.php&amp;hauptrubrik=481&amp;details=10269\">power manager from Brennenstuhl</a> with one main switch and 6 separate switches to selectively toggle my equipment on and off. My cable modem, WLAN router and an
<a href=\"http://www.icydock.com/goods.php?id=33\">ICY DOCK ICYCube</a> sit on top of the power manager.</p><p><img class=\"leftb\" src=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/patrick-welker-atmo1.jpg\" width=\"460\" title=\"Health Appliances\" alt=\"Health Appliances\" /></p><p><img class=\"leftb\" src=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/patrick-welker-atmo2.jpg\" width=\"460\" title=\"Health Appliances\" alt=\"Health Appliances\" /></p><p>The last part of my setup is what I call my health appliances. Strictly speaking they don’t belong to the setup, but I regard them as important components of my work, that’s why I decided to include them here.</p><p>When you live and work all day long within a tight space and share it with another person, my belief is that the room you choose needs to have a feel good atmosphere. Moreover, if it is a home office you have the permission to go nuts. To conclude, for me this means transforming my workspace into a whimsical little world with a touch of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawaii\">kawaii</a>.</p><p>On the wall in front of me is an empty yellow picture frame to which I added a red curtain with a floral pattern on the upper side and a wooden shelf on the bottom. On this shelf is the DVD, the excellent soundtrack and a cinema ticket from one of my favorite movies. Since there is still some space left to fill with cuteness, I put a few anime figures (i.a. from Azumanga Daioh) and a plant. The lower surface of the shelf is covered with artificial turf and little flowers (the latter are hard to spot on the photo).</p><p>Below this frame is my illuminated “cave”. A Philips Living Colors lamp was one of the best investments I made so far for my workspace. It might sound stupid to say this about a lamp, but it really increased my quality of life &mdash; it literally brightens my day. No wonder they call it a <em>mood light</em>.</p><p>The surface of the cave (again) consists of artificial turf and there’s a <a href=\"http://www.usa.philips.com/c/Moodlighting/livingcolors-glossy-white-691503148/prd/en/\">Living Colors Mini</a> on the side of it. On the turf my MacBook rests and charges along with a <a href=\"http://www.frankkozik.net/store\">Stache Labbit from Frank Kozik</a>, another plush rabbit my girlfriend made for me, a branch, a raccoon figure, <a href=\"http://store.iconfactory.com/#ollievinyl\">Ollie</a> and lastly a plush carrot and a marzipan carrot for the rabbits because they always look hungry.</p><p>To the left of my desk is a window bench where a little bowl with an forrest inside of it and some animals is placed. I grew up on the countryside and miss mother nature from time to time, so my girlfriend did some handicraft work and made me this present.</p><p>Other health related gadgets:</p><ul><li>My <em>relatively okay</em><a href=\"http://www.tchibo.de/Schreibtischstuhl-p400030422.html?cs=1&amp;vt=a1d8c71586d0e3af213e9eeb360fd91aa9a8b0fb\">office chair</a> is from Tchibo, a German coffee company which apparently also sells a of lot other things.</li><li>A <a href=\"http://www.thera-band.com/store/products.php?ProductID=21\">Thera-Band Hand Exerciser</a> with an egg shape to fight my arthritis.</li><li>A <a href=\"http://power-bar.co.uk/\">Powerbar 2</a> which I use every time I feel drained.</li><li>An <a href=\"http://www.aquaselect.de/en/wasserfilter_glas.php\">Aqua Select Water Filter</a> because I drink about 1.1 gal (4,2 liters) a day.</li><li>Some plush animals who occasionally visit the office. Yeah, I’m about to turn 32. So what? I’m a child at heart.</li></ul><p>The last piece of equipment on my list is our printer-scanner-fax Swiss army knife &mdash; a <a href=\"http://www.samsung.com/au/consumer/print-solutions/print-multifunctions-copiers/archive/CLX-3185FW/XSA\">Samsung CLX-3185FW</a> &mdash; which is located in the storeroom. It barely gets used since I work pretty much paperless.</p><h4>3. Why this rig?</h4><p>Here’s the short story of how I came across my gear.</p><p><strong>The Big Mac</strong></p><p>I bought the Mac Pro for two reasons. The first reason is that my Power Mac G5 was one of the loudest computers I ever owned. It was terribly nerve-racking for me and all of the smaller audio samples I recorded had the Mac’s omnipresent background noise as <em>a feature</em>. I even bought a soundproof cabinet to tackle that problem. The second reason was that the Mac Pro can take up to four hard drives. I needed a lot of space for storing my audio material and USB or FireWire 800 wasn’t an option for me at that time. The CPU power and the amount of RAM were also pretty helpful when running multiple instances of a demanding plugin in Pro Tools, Ableton Live, and Logic Pro.</p><p>However, now my daily work is writing, reading, coding and designing. I don’t necessarily need a Mac Pro for this kind of work, but since the machine is already here and is still an excellent computer, I see no real need to replace it anytime soon (except if Apple decides to stop supporting it when they release the next version of OS X).</p><p><strong>Peripheral Computer Devices</strong></p><p>I use an English keyboard because it’s part of my “all-in” language learning strategy. Despite German being my native language I write down everything in English. Besides that, I also wanted to try if the keyboard layout is a better fit for writing code, and so far I’m more than happy that I took the plunge. Although it took quite a while to reroute some hard-wired movements to their specific new counterparts on the keyboard. Another thing I have to admit was, that at first I was a tad bummed out since I accidentally bought the international version on eBay. But, I soon realized it was a fitting choice because thereby I gain consistency over all my Macs: for the MacBook I just had to order some keyboard stickers and henceforth all the keys are in the same place again. This wouldn’t have been possible otherwise.</p><p>The second monitor was an <em>heirloom</em> from my father who moved on to an iMac. I was quite happy with one 24-inch screen, but having two displays opened up a whole new world for me. The result is that I’m now really lazy when it comes to managing windows on the Mac.</p><p>The ICYCube has room for 4 hard drives just like the Mac Pro. I searched for a simple multi-bay enclosure and tried quite a few. Since I didn’t need a fancy RAID setup and all I wanted was to slide in the hard disks I already own. This piece of equipment met my criteria perfectly, if I exchange an HD on my Mac Pro I buy a new drive tray for the ICYCube and gain another backup drive. Indeed the enclosure works as my backup solution. At the same time it’s the place where I have stored all my unedited home video recordings which I might not come to edit in a lifetime since I pay way to much attention to details (also I’m not very fast when it comes to editing videos). The downside of the enclosure: it’s pretty loud if you don’t remove the fan. Then again I only fire it up once a week to copy over the backups from my Macs.</p><p>Let’s talk USB for a second. I’ve had trouble with Apple Computers and their USB ports for my whole Apple life (since 2005). I’ve always had a lot of audio equipment connected to my Mac via USB. The Mac’s power supply unit could never satisfy the energy-hungry battalion it was faced with. Even on my 2009 Mac Pro the USB ports began to fail until out of six ports only 3 working ones remained. The best investment I’ve made is an industry USB hub &mdash; it’s the one and only hub that I tried which delivered enough power (and I tried quite a few). The hub I use is from a swiss company, EXSYS. They offer excellent products in this segment of modern technology. My hub has 4.5 A which is more than enough. Every port gets up to 500 mA. All my devices work properly for the first time.</p><p>Regarding the Wacom tablet I have to admit that I neglect it carelessly. My girlfriend borrowed it over the last few years and it just has returned into my possession since she bought herself a Cintiq for Christmas. I have nothing else to add to my defense.</p><p><strong>The Little Apples</strong></p><p>I ride my bike a lot during the week. Be it my route to the University, or, more rarely, visiting a client. If you have carried a laptop before you know that you feel every ounce of it after a few blocks. The 12-inch PowerBook was my favorite portable computer, but the tiny 11-inch MacBook Air is like a dream come true and it instantly pushed the PowerBook off the throne. It’s so small, slim and light that I can take it with me everywhere I go, and in addition I don’t feel like I’m carrying any additional weight. It is amazing that this is not a toy but a full-fledged system for web development and graphic design work. Also, I still prefer it over the iPad when I’m on the go and want to write something. Using an iPad at the University isn’t an option for me because I need to switch between a (digital) book, references and notes all the time. Having two windows open in split view is a great help and the full-sized keyboard is ideal for lectures where I take a lot of notes. Being able to watch and listen while writing down everything in a blind flight over the keyboard is not possible with an iPad (at least not without an external keyboard).</p><p>I still take my iPad with me to University on days where I know I don’t need to write down a lot of information. On those days the MacBook is allowed to stay at home. However, where the iPad shines in my opinion is when working with clients. I prefer to take my iPad with me to them rather than the MacBook because it’s nice to pass it on to people. They instantly know how to use it and get a better feel for how the product they’ve ordered will look and work like.</p><p>Since the retina iPhone was released in June 2010 I knew that Apple would come up with an iPad featuring a similar display. So I decided to wait because I don’t wanted to use a phone or tablet on a daily basis which lacks such a stellar display. In March 2012 the wait was over. I couldn’t afford it at that point in time, but finally managed to buy one… shortly before the released the fourth-generation iPad &mdash; didn’t see that one coming. For me the iPad is the best device for reading and learning in existence. If I find an elaborate tutorial on the internet I usually save it and read it on my iPad.</p><p>Back to the iPad’s little brother. I bought the iPhone 5 because the iPhone is the device I use most religiously out of all my gadgets. Since Apple changed the form factor &mdash; which they presumably keep for a while &mdash; I felt it was the perfect time to update from my old iPhone 4. I use my phone constantly for all kind of tasks, but here’s a small list of where it has proven to be most helpful to me:</p><ul><li>snapping a picture</li><li>reading feeds and Instapaper articles</li><li>as a reference book</li><li>as a companion when working out</li><li>relaxing</li><li>communication</li></ul><p>The accessory that is always with my phone is the BookBook case. It is the ideal choice for me since I always forgot my wallet at home. The purchase has paid for itself: I haven’t had an embarrassing moment at the local grocery store’s counter since I own the BookBook. Everything important is where I iPhone is. My iPhone is at my side 24/7.</p><p><strong>My Audio Gear</strong></p><p>This is a short one. My current setup is the result of a compromise. At the same time I started my studies at the university I moved in together with my girlfriend into a smaller apartment. My complete rack wouldn’t have fitted into the new tiny place. I sold almost all my gear to pay the rent for the upcoming months. Since I always had a passion for graphic and Web design and worked as a freelancer in that field while studying as audio engineering my new economic center shifted. (I still miss part of my gear.)</p><p>I kept the microphones because they barely take up any space. In addition I only own one audio-interface now. It’s from RME. They are famous for their excellent analog-to-digital conversion. You get one of the best conversions you can buy for money &mdash; naturally it’s a keeper too. Another thing I couldn’t bring myself to part with were my speakers. In spite of using headphones almost all the time because my girlfriend doesn’t listen to such a wide variety of music as I do while working, it’s still good to know that I could cause a medium-sized earthquake with the speakers if I feel like it.</p><p>Lastly, I decided to order a smaller keyboard to at least leave the possibility open to produce a little bit in my spare time. Sadly I only managed to make one track per year since 2008. To look on the bright side of things I really amped up my front-end web design skills in that time.</p><h4>4. What software do you use and for what do you use it?</h4><p>There are so many great Mac apps out there in the wild and currently 465 of them are in my applications folder. Here’s a selection of the ones I use most on my Mac:</p><p><strong>Writing:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/\">nvALT</a> is my storage for text and code snippets, links to references, general references, lists and TaskPaper documents. It’s constantly open.</li><li><a href=\"http://www.foldingtext.com/\">FoldingText</a> is my go-to writing application. I just love the clean look, that it auto-formats Markdown and the possibility to fold sections. </li><li>When I’m writing longer articles or take-home exams I switch between FoldingText and <a href=\"http://multimarkdown.com/\">MultiMarkdown Composer</a>.</li><li>Since I write in Markdown all the time, no matter what, I often have <a href=\"http://markedapp.com/\">Marked</a> running to preview my documents.</li><li>I’m also a fan of outlines. <a href=\"https://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnioutliner/\">OmniOutliner Pro</a> and <a href=\"http://www.topoftree.jp/en/\">Tree</a> are often starting points for more elaborate projects.</li><li>When writing research papers for the University I use <a href=\"http://pomodoro.ugolandini.com/\">Pomodoro</a> because if I don’t I have trouble focusing on the job at hand.</li></ul><p><strong>Reading:</strong></p><p>On the Mac I use the Google Reader web application to read my feeds. I haven’t yet looked for an alternative for when the service shuts down. I might end up finally using the <a href=\"http://feverapp.com/\">Fever</a> installation I set up a while ago or even go back to <a href=\"http://www.netnewswireapp.com\">NetNewsWire</a>.</p><p>When I read on the Mac it’s usually in a browser. <a href=\"http://www.google.com/chrome\">Google Chrome</a> is my browser of choice. I’m a heavy <a href=\"http://www.pinboard.in/\">Pinboard</a> user and Chrome extensions are my favorite way of adding and searching my bookmarks.</p><p><strong>Coding:</strong></p><p>When I code a website I use <a href=\"https://www.panic.com/CODA/\">Coda 2</a> since it has smart features I still miss in other editors. I find it most helpful that Coda remembers my open tabs on a per project basis. Even more important, it remembers the split tabs where I grouped documents that are interacting with each other. It’s a great feature that I specially enjoy every time when revive an old project.</p><p>To preview websites on my mobile devices I use <a href=\"http://html.adobe.com/edge/inspect/\">Adobe’s Edge Inspect</a> and <a href=\"http://livereload.com/\">LiveReload</a>.</p><p>To store tutorials, references, books about web development and sites that inspire me I use <a href=\"http://reinventedsoftware.com/together/\">Together</a>. What I like about it is that it doesn’t use a single database file. I can drop files into specific folders and they automatically get tagged when I open Together.</p><p>If there is something to code and it is no website, then my favorite editor is <a href=\"http://www.sublimetext.com/\">Sublime Text 2</a> &mdash; if it would remember the split sets like Coda I’d instantly switch to it since it’s so highly customizable.</p><p>I also use <a href=\"http://www.git-tower.com/\">Tower</a> for managing my git repositories. Terminal and <a href=\"http://www.iterm2.com/\">iTerm</a> apps companions for my way through the shell.</p><p><strong>Designing:</strong></p><p>I’m paying Adobe to let me use their feature rich programs aka Photoshop and Illustrator.</p><p>To optimize images for the web I use <a href=\"http://jpegmini.com\">JPEGmini</a> and the hand-made <a href=\"http://imageoptim.com/\">ImageOptim</a> I wrote about in my blog.</p><p><strong>Audio:</strong></p><p>When it comes to listing I’m still undecided whether to stick with <a href=\"http://www.rdio.com/\">Rdio</a> or <a href=\"http://www.spotify.com/\">Spotify</a>.

OmniFocus is the main brain which keeps me from forgetting tasks. I prefer the Mac version over both of the iOS apps in terms of swiftness when it comes to organizing tasks.</li><li><a href=\"https://agilebits.com/onepassword\">1Password</a> is another application which is constantly open.

A lot of them are tucked away in a folders. I keep barely-used applications around for easy access in case I really need them. A good example for rarely-used apps would be all the ones that are specific to my home town. On the iPad, however, I don’t have a lot of these specialists. But I have more folders with apps that I haven’t checked out yet. In any case, here’s what I use on a regular basis.</p><p>I write in <a href=\"http://agiletortoise.com/drafts\">Drafts</a> despite  preferring the Markdown toolbar of <a href=\"http://gokarbon.com/scratch/\">Scratch</a>. The iPad version of Drafts has one, and I’m still hoping that the iPhone gets one too some day.</p><p>If I need to make corrections to a post I open <a href=\"http://bywordapp.com/\">Byword</a> and edit the post. And while we’re at the blog, sometimes I have to open <a href=\"https://www.panic.com/prompt/\">Prompt</a> to analyze a problem or restart my Jekyll blog.</p><p>The header images for my blog are drawn in <a href=\"http://www.fiftythree.com/paper\">Paper</a>. I love its ease of use, the app is also the starting point for all of my mockups and general ideas for websites.</p><p>When I need to share files with someone I use Dropbox, ClouDrop for Cloudapp, or ClouDrop for Dropbox by <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/touchmiphone/id321133814\">TouchMyPhone</a>. If I want my screen shots on my Mac I use <a href=\"http://www.photosync-app.com/\">PhotoSync</a> since it’s faster than waiting for iCloud to sync the files in question.</p><p>For research I have couple of apps that most folks will be familiar with: <a href=\"http://albinadevelopment.com/pinbook\">Pinbook</a> and <a href=\"http://www.delibarapp.com/iphone/\">Delitouch iPhone</a> for browsing Pinboard, <a href=\"http://tapbots.com/software/tweetbot/\">Tweetbot</a>, <a href=\"http://kepner.me/apps/\">Bang On</a>, and Google Chrome.</p><p>In addition, I always have my iPhone at hand while reading &mdash; if there’s a need to clarify something I open up one of my Dictionaries. I have a couple for different purposes: linguistics ones, literature specific ones, and one for every coding language.</p><p>My RSS client of choice is <a href=\"http://reederapp.com/\">Reeder</a> on the iPhone and <a href=\"http://www.curioustimes.de/mrreader/index.html\">Mr. Reader</a> on the iPad. If I find something I like to act on or would like to link it goes into <a href=\"http://getpocket.com/\">Pocket</a>, and if it’s a longer read I send it to <a href=\"http://www.instapaper.com/iphone\">Instapaper</a> &mdash; both of these apps are jam-packed to the point that I doubt I can ever catch up with everything in there. If I’m about to continue working on another device I open the article in question with Google Chrome to ensure that I can resume where I left off.</p><p>Apart from reading feeds I also like to read books on the iPad. I collect them in my Dropbox and import them into iBooks via <a href=\"http://www.goodiware.com/goodreader.html\">GoodReader</a> or DropCopy. If it’s a shorter PDF I read it directly in GoodReader.</p><p>When I study for a test I use <a href=\"http://orangeorapple.com/Flashcards/\">Flashcards Deluxe</a>. I have a macro which formats a Markdown document of my study notes into the format that the app reads. The macro also puts the file into my Dropbox. All I have to do is to import the file and start learning.</p><p>Beforehand I admitted that I barely use my scanner. I digitalize University or office documents most of the times with <a href=\"http://readdle.com/products/scanner_pro\">Scanner Pro</a> and send them directly to my Dropbox.</p><p>While we’re still in the category of work related apps that I use most frequently, there are some classics that are hits on the iPhone for a reason. These ones are on my Homes creen:  <a href=\"http://appcubby.com/launch-center/\">LaunchCenterPro</a>, <a href=\"http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnifocus-iphone/\">OmniFocus</a>, <a href=\"http://www.sparrowmailapp.com/iphone.php\">Sparrow</a>, <a href=\"https://agilebits.com/onepassword/ios\">1Password</a>, <a href=\"http://flexibits.com/fantastical-iphone\">Fantastical</a>, and the TomTom navigation app.</p><p>I mentioned in the beginning that health plays a big role for me when it comes to work. Here’s one of my shorter morning rituals and the apps I use with it: my day starts with two glasses of water, then I put my bluetooth headphones on, fire up Spotify and select some relaxing music for my Yoga exercises. <a href=\"http://www.repeattimerapp.com/\">Repeat Timer Pro</a> is the best app I found so far for basic interval training.</p><p>To conclude this section about apps I use for working, I also want to end with Spotify since music can increase creativity and help to focus better. I often use my iPhone or iPad to play music instead of my Mac. Unlike the Mac version of Spotify the mobile app doesn’t chuck away on my upload stream. I send the audio signal to <a href=\"http://www.rogueamoeba.com/airfoil/\">Airfoil Speakers</a> on my Mac and I’m good. Furthermore, to focus while studying I have a binaural playlist on Spotify and this little collection of apps: <a href=\"http://www.dataca.com/Attractor.html\">Attractor</a>, <a href=\"http://www.redpiston.com/our_work.php\">MindWave 2</a>, and some <a href=\"http://www.teslasoftware.com/\">AmbiScience</a> apps.</p><p><strong>iOS &mdash; Everyday Life:</strong></p><p>My smartphone has alleviated my everyday life, that’s for sure. Here are some key aspects where I find it utterly useful:</p><p><a href=\"http://notesy-app.com/\">Notesy</a> is one of the most important apps on my phone. Everything that’s inside of nvALT is also in Notesy, for instance when I plan to cook something new I save the recipe in my notes folder and have the Markdown preview right in front of me. I have an array of <a href=\"http://www.dueapp.com/\">Due</a> timers for cooking and baking.</p><p>If I’m not working it is highly likely that I have my headphones on and listen to a podcast via <a href=\"http://www.downcastapp.com/\">Downcast</a> or even better, an audiobook (I’m a sucker for audiobooks).</p><p>The iPhone is also my main camera, so <a href=\"http://campl.us\">Camera+</a> and the default camera app are on my Home screen to make sure I can easily access them any time. I sold my regular cameras because the iPhone suits my needs just fine. I’m the point-and-click guy when it comes to capturing moments, and it’s enough for me.</p><p>Another thing I like to do on iOS is to remote control my Mac with <a href=\"http://www.stairways.com/iphone/\">Keyboard Maestro Control</a> or <a href=\"http://www.iteleportmobile.com/\">iTeleport</a>. Most of the time it’s nothing important but it’s a nice feature I like to use when I’m on the couch.</p><p>The last big point where the iPhone shines for me is it helps me to keep track of…</p><ul><li>my lists with <a href=\"http://listaryapp.com/\">Listary</a>;</li><li>cartoons and series I’m following with <a href=\"http://www.itvshowsapp.com/\">iTV Shows</a>;</li><li>movies I want to see in the cinema with <a href=\"http://www.taphive.com/todomovies/\">TodoMovies</a> (side note: I hope to see a <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/\">Letterboxd</a> app some day);</li><li>apps that I want to buy with <a href=\"http://appshopper.com/\">AppShopper</a>;</li><li>the weather with <a href=\"http://www.weatherpro.eu/\">WeatherPro</a> (which has proven to be the most reliable app for Europe, but not the most beautiful), and <a href=\"http://www.rainalarmapp.com/\">RainAlarm</a> (since there is no Dark Sky for Europe).</li></ul><h4>5. How does this setup help you do your best creative work?</h4><p>At some point in my twenties I suddenly realized that I had back pain many a time, that I gained some weight, and that my mood swings were in fact a full-grown chronic depression. It was obvious that I couldn’t perform my best under these circumstances.</p><p>To fight all of the above I started to do Yoga along with some other exercises, to eat more healthy and to create a work environment which makes me happy. In the last 5 years I managed to drop the extra 22 pounds (10 kg) I gained beforehand and developed an interest in cooking which revealed that one’s own kitchen can serve better food than 90-percent of the restaurants in the close vicinity. These measures lead to fewer periods of depression which I’m very thankful for.</p><p>If you work on a desk with a monitor in front of your face from dusk till dawn, then time truly flies. I get easily distracted; I even managed to ignore my own health. By taking breaks and exercising I find myself to be more cheerful, recharged, and overall a bit healthier. It’s a wonder by all the optimizations I made to tweak my operating system that it took so long for me to recognize that my body’s “OS” also was in need of more organization and maintenance.</p><p>My point with the 3 paragraphs above is that a healthy body is the only way for me to not drop into a hole of darkness. My other tactic to reduce the likeliness of such a thing happening is to surround myself with stuff that makes me happy. That’s why I called the constituents of my playful environment “health appliances”.</p><p>To keep this system running, a good part of my setup consists of different ways to remind me to eat, exercise, and take a break. I change those reminders regularly so that I don’t get too accustomed to one set, otherwise I would sit on my Mac non-stop and forget everything around me. I don’t know the feeling of being bored when I’m in front of one of my gadgets. Combined with decent internet access they work like a creativity accelerator for me. I always find stuff to do and have a variety of lists where I gather different creative projects.</p><p>The Mac and iOS devices do a splendid job at reminding me of my goals and showing me what I could and should do next. The only glitch in the system is me, since it’s me who sometimes ignores the good advice and gets lost in a side-project.</p><h4>6. How would your ideal setup look and function?</h4><p>A 13-inch MacBook would be sufficient for me to get things done &mdash; I’ve worked with one for years. But since I’m allowed to dream a little bit, here we go:</p><p>I would love to trade in the two 24-inch displays for one larger retina display. I hope Apple has something in the pipe to can make the Retina Cinema Display work over Thunderbolt &mdash; from what I’ve read Thunderbolt could be the bottleneck there.</p><p>Particularly with regard to the high energy consumption of the Mac Pro in combination with the two monitors, I can imagine a more lightweight solution. My number one requirement would be a retina display &mdash; be it an iMac or a MacBook with a large retina Cinema Display. The next technical condition would be a multi-bay enclosures that is <em>silent</em>, affordable, and fast (think Thunderbolt) to make up for the 4 drive bays which I would leave behind. I just don’t see the latter three conditions happening at the moment.</p><p>Speaking of gadgets, here are some more realistic purchases I plan to acquire. I think an <a href=\"http://adonit.net/jot/pro/\">Adonit Jot Pro</a> might do a better job when writing things in the Papers app, and another nice addition to my setup would be the <a href=\"http://www.twelvesouth.com/products/plugbugworld/\">Twelve South PlugBug World</a>.</p><p>Besides the above mentioned, switching to a lightweight setup feels far away. Some of my gear speaks another language: my MacBook’s display for instance. The right side on my smallest Mac is malfunctioning &mdash; it flickers like crazy. Sooner or later the computer needs to get replaced. The next defect device is my bluetooth Sennheiser. I dropped it on a marble floor because the carabiner with which I attached it to my Ristretto bag snapped open while I was fumbling in the bag. I was toying with the idea of switching the brand. The problem is, I only know of one pair of bluetooth headphones that has no problems switching between multiple bluetooth devices, but it isn’t on par with the Sennheiser quality-wise. So my wish would be a good set of headphones where switching from the Mac to my iPhone or iPad is effortlessly possible. Luckily Airfoil exists and so I will swallow the bitter pill and send in my Sennheiser as soon as I have enough cash to pay for the costly repairing.</p><p>Since I talked keyboards before, if I were to buy a new MacBook, this time I would order one with a genuine US English keyboard. And in addition, after reading about <a href=\"http://shawnblanc.net/2012/06/brett-terpstras-sweet-mac-setup/\">Brett Terpstra’s switch to the bluetooth aluminum keyboard here on the Sweet Mac Setups</a>, I can picture myself trying to make the switch to a bluetooth keyboard for my desktop Mac too. I was afraid that I would miss all the lovely extra options for additional shortcuts which a numeric keypad provides, but there are other ways to work around that. A bluetooth keyboard would also work great with the iPad.</p><p>The last item on the wish list gadget-wise is a NAS. I’ve being comparing the pros and cons of a NAS vs. a Mac mini lately, and at the moment a NAS server from Synology has the best chances to be one of my next investments. Okay, since this part of Sweet Mac Setups is encouraging dreaming it would be a NAS at home and a Mac mini from Macminicolo.net (which I just can’t afford anytime soon) to have my own powerful server.</p><p>That’s about it for the gadgets. In terms of a better workflow I wish that I’d already have a more automated way to post on my blog. On the Mac it’s already happening, but my goal from the beginning was to make it work with the iPad too. I’d like to send my drawings from the Paper app to my (shared) server. Federico Viticci’s has a crazy cool Pythonista workflow, and I hope to get there too. On the server the images should get optimized, filed into my upload directory and the corresponding Markdown image links should be appended to a scratch file.</p><p>Another workflow issue I have is when I write something for University. Sometimes Markdown doesn’t cut the chase. Here, with all the footnotes, citations, annotations and references Pandoc sounds like the better solution. I definitely have to look into it (… and Scrivener).</p><p>There’s also an application wish I have had for a long time: Listary for Dropbox. I’d like to keep everything that closely resembles a note inside my nvALT folder and I still haven’t found a better list app than Listary.</p><p>Lastly, some enhancements for my work environment: I want some nice graffiti for the concrete bricks on my desk.</p><p>Almost all of the above is not really important. Like I stated in the beginning. A 13-inch MacBook is enough to get the work done. But there are things that would be great long-term investments. By far my biggest wish is a fancy desk which is adjustable in height so that I can switch from working in a chair to working on a standing desk. The best thing I come across so far is the <a href=\"http://www.anthro.com/products/elevate-adjusta\">Anthro Elevate Adjusta</a> (check out <a href=\"http://youtu.be/AeUFcGiQznw\">this</a> YoutTube video for a short demo of the basic functions).</p><p>Along the lines of a more ergonomic workspace my second biggest wish is <a href=\"http://www.sanaform-falto.de/section/products/collection/falto-organic/wip_27__________wip_37.html\">the Falto Wip 37</a>. I tested it on a trade show years ago and have fallen in love with it since.</p><p>That’s it. Sorry for being a chatterbox and breaking the character count record here on Sweet Mac Setups.</p><h3>More Sweet Setups</h3><p>Patrick’s setup is one in <a href=\"http://shawnblanc.net/sweet-mac-setups/\">a series of sweet Mac Setups</a>.</p>" "http://shawnblanc.net/2013/03/patrick-welker-sweet-mac-setup/" (20820 20617) new 10 nil nil ((title nil "✚ Patrick Welker’s Sweet Mac Setup") (link nil "http://shawnblanc.net/2013/03/patrick-welker-sweet-mac-setup/") (comments nil "http://shawnblanc.net/2013/03/patrick-welker-sweet-mac-setup/#comments") (pubDate nil "Thu, 28 Mar 2013 14:15:37 +0000") (dc:creator nil "Shawn Blanc") (category nil "Articles") (category nil "Sweet Mac Setups") (category nil "Too Nerdy for Words") (guid ((isPermaLink .

She&#8217;s a 3D artist and I do graphic and web design whenever there&#8217;s an occasional job for me.</p><p>I&#8217;m also a part-time student. My fields of study are English and German. Prior to that I was an audio engineer. Since I&#8217;d have to relocate and leave my girlfriend behind to stay in business I decided to listen to my heart which resulted in me staying in the city and starting to study &#8220;something which involves reading and writing&#8221;.</p><p>I let my inner geek out at <a href=\"http://rocketink.net\">RocketINK</a> where I write about how I tweak my Mac. Beside that being my number one topic, I have plans to write some more personal and in-depth pieces.</p><h4>2. What is your current setup?</h4><p><img class=\"leftb\" src=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/patrick-welker-mac-setup.jpg\" width=\"460\" title=\"Patrick Welker Desk Overview\" alt=\"Patrick Welker Desk Overview\" /></p><p><img class=\"leftb\" src=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/patrick-welker-displays.jpg\" height=\" \" width=\"460\" title=\"Patrick Welker Displays\" alt=\"Patrick Welker Displays\" /></p><p>Almost all my gear is placed on a large 15-year-old desk. I don&#8217;t know the exact model but when looking at the construction I guess it is a safe bet to say that its origin is a Swedish furniture store (hint: four-letter word, all caps).</p><p>My main machine is a 2x 2.8 GHz Quad-Core Xeon Mac Pro with 10GB of RAM, and it is connected to two 24-inch Dell displays (model: 2405FPW) which give me enough space to toy around with. The first hard drive bay with the operation system is a 160GB SSD from Intel, the other three bays carry bigger regular hard disks.</p><p>I&#8217;m a die-hard fan of the wired Apple aluminum keyboard. This particular one is the English version, more specific: the international one with a larger return key and some other minor differences. Oddly enough it isn&#8217;t listed in the Apple Store anymore. Furthermore I also own a Magic Trackpad which is placed to the right of the keyboard along with a Magic Mouse. I switch frequently between the mouse and the trackpad. If I feel that my wrist is overstrained I throw my mouse into the drawer for the rest of the day and use the trackpad. Apart from this being my regular setup, sometimes I put the trackpad on the left side of the keyboard just to scroll through documents and use my left hand a bit more.</p><p><img class=\"leftb\" src=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/patrick-welker-portables.jpg\" width=\"460\" title=\"Patrick Welker Portables\" alt=\"Patrick Welker Portables\" /></p><p>My secondary Mac is an 11-inch MacBook Air (1.6 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo, 4GB RAM) which I tend to neglect when I&#8217;m at home and not working on the Mac Pro. My 32GB third-generation iPad is now the undisputed champion of the living room and gives the MacBook a hard time finding the attention it deserves. When my iPad is resting it sits on the <a href=\"http://www.twelvesouth.com/products/compass/\">Compass</a> stand from Twelve South. The daring position of the Compass is on the left edge of my desk… and so far my iPad took the plunge &#8220;only&#8221; once. Terrible, I know.</p><p>The following are my additional gadgets for the iPad: (my girlfriend&#8217;s) <a href=\"http://the-maglus.myshopify.com/\">Maglus Stylus</a>, an old $5 pogo stylus, a black leather Smart Cover, a <a href=\"http://www.toddygear.com/shop/Toddy-Smart-Cloth/5x7/HauteToddy/Havana\">Havana smart cloth</a> from Toddy Gear and a <a href=\"http://tabuproducts.com/shop/pouch-2/\">Tabü tablet poüch</a> to give the iPad some extra protection.</p><p>When I&#8217;m on the road I use a messenger bag to carry my MacBook and iPad. I choose to go with the <a href=\"http://www.tombihn.com/laptop_bags/TB0221.html\">Ristretto from Tom Bihn</a> (link to successor) despite the high shipping costs and customs tax that are due when importing something from the United States. The bag is equipped with the fantastic <a href=\"http://www.tombihn.com/accessories/TB0505.html\">Absolute Shoulder Strap</a> and a lot of their nifty pouches and leashes. Ninety percent of the times when I leave the house I travel with my bike, and due to Tom Bihn&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.tombihn.com/accessories/GDF-LIGHT.html\">Guardian Dual Function Light</a> I feel a lot safer when riding in the dark.</p><p>In case I&#8217;m not on one of the above mentioned devices my right hand becomes unusable for common tasks. You might think this is because I&#8217;m such a reasonable person and finally give my hand some rest, let it calm down after the heavy duty mouse and keyboard work it endured. Far from it! It&#8217;s unusable because it automatically grabs my 32GB iPhone and merges with it. I have the theory that this is a widespread disease. By the way, my phone is wrapped in a <a href=\"http://twelvesouth.com/products/bookbook_iphone5/\">BookBook case</a>. Despite the fact that I love the look and feel of a naked iPhone (after all it&#8217;s a beautiful device), for me the sheer practicality of the case justifies adding a bit of bulk.</p><p><img class=\"leftb\" src=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/patrick-welker-audio.jpg\" width=\"460\" title=\"Patrick Welker Audio Gear\" alt=\"Patrick Welker Audio Gear\" /></p><p>Now we come to the relicts of my activity as a producer.

Secondly, my current Mic setup consists of an <a href=\"http://www.akg.com/site/products/powerslave,id,219,pid,219,nodeid,2,_language,EN.html\">AKG C 4000 B Studio</a> (a condenser microphone) and the <a href=\"http://www.shure.com/americas/products/microphones/sm/sm58-vocal-microphone\">Shure SM58</a> (a dynamic microphone).</p><p>Next, my midi-controller is a Novation ReMOTE 37SL and the audio interface of my choice is a <a href=\"http://www.rme-audio.de/en_products_fireface_400.php\">RME Fireface 400</a>. Finally, the last part of my audio gear are three headphones: a Philips SHP8900 for listening, an <a href=\"http://www.akg.com/site/products/powerslave,id,252,pid,252,nodeid,2,_language,EN.html\">AKG K240 Studio</a> as my personal reference monitor and a <a href=\"http://en-us.sennheiser.com/wireless-bluetooth-headset-stereo-mm-550-x-travel\">Sennheiser MM 550 Travel</a> (link to successor).</p><p>Lastly, there is just enough room for one more gadget on the desk: my old Wacom Intuos 3 (6&#215;8).</p><p><img class=\"leftb\" src=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/patrick-welker-below.jpg\" width=\"460\" alt=\"Below the desk\" /></p><p>On the lower surface of my desktop is a <a href=\"http://www.exsys.ch/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=210&amp;language=en&amp;zenid=b3cd9a33f27d7d5cd4c985e1937ed543\">EXSYS EX-1177</a> USB 2.0 HUB with 7 ports.

I label all cables going into the hub by writing the name of the gadget with a felt marker on a piece of crepe tape.</p><p>Beside my Mac a drawer unit is also placed under my desk. In the first drawer are pens and chargers to my various gadgets. Additionally, to have my Tom Bihn pouches close at hand the second drawer is solely reserved to them. On top of the drawer is a <a href=\"http://brennenstuhl.de/content.php?Produkte%2FPower+Distribution%2FSurge+Protection%2FPower+Manager+PMA+USB+15.000+A&amp;seite=shop/produkte.php&amp;hauptrubrik=481&amp;details=10269\">power manager from Brennenstuhl</a> with one main switch and 6 separate switches to selectively toggle my equipment on and off. My cable modem, WLAN router and an 
<a href=\"http://www.icydock.com/goods.php?id=33\">ICY DOCK ICYCube</a> sit on top of the power manager.</p><p><img class=\"leftb\" src=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/patrick-welker-atmo1.jpg\" width=\"460\" title=\"Health Appliances\" alt=\"Health Appliances\" /></p><p><img class=\"leftb\" src=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/patrick-welker-atmo2.jpg\" width=\"460\" title=\"Health Appliances\" alt=\"Health Appliances\" /></p><p>The last part of my setup is what I call my health appliances. Strictly speaking they don&#8217;t belong to the setup, but I regard them as important components of my work, that&#8217;s why I decided to include them here.</p><p>When you live and work all day long within a tight space and share it with another person, my belief is that the room you choose needs to have a feel good atmosphere. Moreover, if it is a home office you have the permission to go nuts. To conclude, for me this means transforming my workspace into a whimsical little world with a touch of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawaii\">kawaii</a>.</p><p>On the wall in front of me is an empty yellow picture frame to which I added a red curtain with a floral pattern on the upper side and a wooden shelf on the bottom. On this shelf is the DVD, the excellent soundtrack and a cinema ticket from one of my favorite movies. Since there is still some space left to fill with cuteness, I put a few anime figures (i.a. from Azumanga Daioh) and a plant. The lower surface of the shelf is covered with artificial turf and little flowers (the latter are hard to spot on the photo).</p><p>Below this frame is my illuminated &#8220;cave&#8221;. A Philips Living Colors lamp was one of the best investments I made so far for my workspace. It might sound stupid to say this about a lamp, but it really increased my quality of life &mdash; it literally brightens my day. No wonder they call it a <em>mood light</em>.</p><p>The surface of the cave (again) consists of artificial turf and there&#8217;s a <a href=\"http://www.usa.philips.com/c/Moodlighting/livingcolors-glossy-white-691503148/prd/en/\">Living Colors Mini</a> on the side of it. On the turf my MacBook rests and charges along with a <a href=\"http://www.frankkozik.net/store\">Stache Labbit from Frank Kozik</a>, another plush rabbit my girlfriend made for me, a branch, a raccoon figure, <a href=\"http://store.iconfactory.com/#ollievinyl\">Ollie</a> and lastly a plush carrot and a marzipan carrot for the rabbits because they always look hungry.</p><p>To the left of my desk is a window bench where a little bowl with an forrest inside of it and some animals is placed. I grew up on the countryside and miss mother nature from time to time, so my girlfriend did some handicraft work and made me this present.</p><p>Other health related gadgets:</p><ul><li>My <em>relatively okay</em><a href=\"http://www.tchibo.de/Schreibtischstuhl-p400030422.html?cs=1&amp;vt=a1d8c71586d0e3af213e9eeb360fd91aa9a8b0fb\">office chair</a> is from Tchibo, a German coffee company which apparently also sells a of lot other things.</li><li>A <a href=\"http://www.thera-band.com/store/products.php?ProductID=21\">Thera-Band Hand Exerciser</a> with an egg shape to fight my arthritis.</li><li>A <a href=\"http://power-bar.co.uk/\">Powerbar 2</a> which I use every time I feel drained.</li><li>An <a href=\"http://www.aquaselect.de/en/wasserfilter_glas.php\">Aqua Select Water Filter</a> because I drink about 1.1 gal (4,2 liters) a day.</li><li>Some plush animals who occasionally visit the office. Yeah, I&#8217;m about to turn 32. So what? I&#8217;m a child at heart.</li></ul><p>The last piece of equipment on my list is our printer-scanner-fax Swiss army knife &mdash; a <a href=\"http://www.samsung.com/au/consumer/print-solutions/print-multifunctions-copiers/archive/CLX-3185FW/XSA\">Samsung CLX-3185FW</a> &mdash; which is located in the storeroom. It barely gets used since I work pretty much paperless.</p><h4>3. Why this rig?</h4><p>Here&#8217;s the short story of how I came across my gear.</p><p><strong>The Big Mac</strong></p><p>I bought the Mac Pro for two reasons. The first reason is that my Power Mac G5 was one of the loudest computers I ever owned. It was terribly nerve-racking for me and all of the smaller audio samples I recorded had the Mac&#8217;s omnipresent background noise as <em>a feature</em>. I even bought a soundproof cabinet to tackle that problem. The second reason was that the Mac Pro can take up to four hard drives. I needed a lot of space for storing my audio material and USB or FireWire 800 wasn&#8217;t an option for me at that time. The CPU power and the amount of RAM were also pretty helpful when running multiple instances of a demanding plugin in Pro Tools, Ableton Live, and Logic Pro.</p><p>However, now my daily work is writing, reading, coding and designing. I don&#8217;t necessarily need a Mac Pro for this kind of work, but since the machine is already here and is still an excellent computer, I see no real need to replace it anytime soon (except if Apple decides to stop supporting it when they release the next version of OS X).</p><p><strong>Peripheral Computer Devices</strong></p><p>I use an English keyboard because it&#8217;s part of my &#8220;all-in&#8221; language learning strategy. Despite German being my native language I write down everything in English. Besides that, I also wanted to try if the keyboard layout is a better fit for writing code, and so far I&#8217;m more than happy that I took the plunge. Although it took quite a while to reroute some hard-wired movements to their specific new counterparts on the keyboard. Another thing I have to admit was, that at first I was a tad bummed out since I accidentally bought the international version on eBay. But, I soon realized it was a fitting choice because thereby I gain consistency over all my Macs: for the MacBook I just had to order some keyboard stickers and henceforth all the keys are in the same place again. This wouldn&#8217;t have been possible otherwise.</p><p>The second monitor was an <em>heirloom</em> from my father who moved on to an iMac. I was quite happy with one 24-inch screen, but having two displays opened up a whole new world for me. The result is that I&#8217;m now really lazy when it comes to managing windows on the Mac.</p><p>The ICYCube has room for 4 hard drives just like the Mac Pro. I searched for a simple multi-bay enclosure and tried quite a few. Since I didn&#8217;t need a fancy RAID setup and all I wanted was to slide in the hard disks I already own. This piece of equipment met my criteria perfectly, if I exchange an HD on my Mac Pro I buy a new drive tray for the ICYCube and gain another backup drive. Indeed the enclosure works as my backup solution. At the same time it&#8217;s the place where I have stored all my unedited home video recordings which I might not come to edit in a lifetime since I pay way to much attention to details (also I&#8217;m not very fast when it comes to editing videos). The downside of the enclosure: it&#8217;s pretty loud if you don&#8217;t remove the fan. Then again I only fire it up once a week to copy over the backups from my Macs.</p><p>Let&#8217;s talk USB for a second. I&#8217;ve had trouble with Apple Computers and their USB ports for my whole Apple life (since 2005). I&#8217;ve always had a lot of audio equipment connected to my Mac via USB. The Mac&#8217;s power supply unit could never satisfy the energy-hungry battalion it was faced with. Even on my 2009 Mac Pro the USB ports began to fail until out of six ports only 3 working ones remained. The best investment I&#8217;ve made is an industry USB hub &mdash; it&#8217;s the one and only hub that I tried which delivered enough power (and I tried quite a few). The hub I use is from a swiss company, EXSYS. They offer excellent products in this segment of modern technology. My hub has 4.5 A which is more than enough. Every port gets up to 500 mA. All my devices work properly for the first time.</p><p>Regarding the Wacom tablet I have to admit that I neglect it carelessly. My girlfriend borrowed it over the last few years and it just has returned into my possession since she bought herself a Cintiq for Christmas. I have nothing else to add to my defense.</p><p><strong>The Little Apples</strong></p><p>I ride my bike a lot during the week. Be it my route to the University, or, more rarely, visiting a client. If you have carried a laptop before you know that you feel every ounce of it after a few blocks. The 12-inch PowerBook was my favorite portable computer, but the tiny 11-inch MacBook Air is like a dream come true and it instantly pushed the PowerBook off the throne. It&#8217;s so small, slim and light that I can take it with me everywhere I go, and in addition I don&#8217;t feel like I&#8217;m carrying any additional weight. It is amazing that this is not a toy but a full-fledged system for web development and graphic design work. Also, I still prefer it over the iPad when I&#8217;m on the go and want to write something. Using an iPad at the University isn&#8217;t an option for me because I need to switch between a (digital) book, references and notes all the time. Having two windows open in split view is a great help and the full-sized keyboard is ideal for lectures where I take a lot of notes. Being able to watch and listen while writing down everything in a blind flight over the keyboard is not possible with an iPad (at least not without an external keyboard).</p><p>I still take my iPad with me to University on days where I know I don&#8217;t need to write down a lot of information. On those days the MacBook is allowed to stay at home. However, where the iPad shines in my opinion is when working with clients. I prefer to take my iPad with me to them rather than the MacBook because it&#8217;s nice to pass it on to people. They instantly know how to use it and get a better feel for how the product they&#8217;ve ordered will look and work like.</p><p>Since the retina iPhone was released in June 2010 I knew that Apple would come up with an iPad featuring a similar display. So I decided to wait because I don&#8217;t wanted to use a phone or tablet on a daily basis which lacks such a stellar display. In March 2012 the wait was over. I couldn&#8217;t afford it at that point in time, but finally managed to buy one… shortly before the released the fourth-generation iPad &mdash; didn&#8217;t see that one coming. For me the iPad is the best device for reading and learning in existence. If I find an elaborate tutorial on the internet I usually save it and read it on my iPad.</p><p>Back to the iPad&#8217;s little brother. I bought the iPhone 5 because the iPhone is the device I use most religiously out of all my gadgets. Since Apple changed the form factor &mdash; which they presumably keep for a while &mdash; I felt it was the perfect time to update from my old iPhone 4. I use my phone constantly for all kind of tasks, but here&#8217;s a small list of where it has proven to be most helpful to me:</p><ul><li>snapping a picture</li><li>reading feeds and Instapaper articles</li><li>as a reference book</li><li>as a companion when working out</li><li>relaxing</li><li>communication</li></ul><p>The accessory that is always with my phone is the BookBook case. It is the ideal choice for me since I always forgot my wallet at home. The purchase has paid for itself: I haven&#8217;t had an embarrassing moment at the local grocery store&#8217;s counter since I own the BookBook. Everything important is where I iPhone is. My iPhone is at my side 24/7.</p><p><strong>My Audio Gear</strong></p><p>This is a short one. My current setup is the result of a compromise. At the same time I started my studies at the university I moved in together with my girlfriend into a smaller apartment. My complete rack wouldn&#8217;t have fitted into the new tiny place. I sold almost all my gear to pay the rent for the upcoming months. Since I always had a passion for graphic and Web design and worked as a freelancer in that field while studying as audio engineering my new economic center shifted. (I still miss part of my gear.)</p><p>I kept the microphones because they barely take up any space. In addition I only own one audio-interface now. It&#8217;s from RME. They are famous for their excellent analog-to-digital conversion. You get one of the best conversions you can buy for money &mdash; naturally it&#8217;s a keeper too. Another thing I couldn&#8217;t bring myself to part with were my speakers. In spite of using headphones almost all the time because my girlfriend doesn&#8217;t listen to such a wide variety of music as I do while working, it&#8217;s still good to know that I could cause a medium-sized earthquake with the speakers if I feel like it.</p><p>Lastly, I decided to order a smaller keyboard to at least leave the possibility open to produce a little bit in my spare time. Sadly I only managed to make one track per year since 2008. To look on the bright side of things I really amped up my front-end web design skills in that time.</p><h4>4. What software do you use and for what do you use it?</h4><p>There are so many great Mac apps out there in the wild and currently 465 of them are in my applications folder. Here&#8217;s a selection of the ones I use most on my Mac:</p><p><strong>Writing:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/\">nvALT</a> is my storage for text and code snippets, links to references, general references, lists and TaskPaper documents. It&#8217;s constantly open.</li><li><a href=\"http://www.foldingtext.com/\">FoldingText</a> is my go-to writing application. I just love the clean look, that it auto-formats Markdown and the possibility to fold sections. </li><li>When I&#8217;m writing longer articles or take-home exams I switch between FoldingText and <a href=\"http://multimarkdown.com/\">MultiMarkdown Composer</a>.</li><li>Since I write in Markdown all the time, no matter what, I often have <a href=\"http://markedapp.com/\">Marked</a> running to preview my documents.</li><li>I&#8217;m also a fan of outlines. <a href=\"https://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnioutliner/\">OmniOutliner Pro</a> and <a href=\"http://www.topoftree.jp/en/\">Tree</a> are often starting points for more elaborate projects.</li><li>When writing research papers for the University I use <a href=\"http://pomodoro.ugolandini.com/\">Pomodoro</a> because if I don&#8217;t I have trouble focusing on the job at hand.</li></ul><p><strong>Reading:</strong></p><p>On the Mac I use the Google Reader web application to read my feeds. I haven&#8217;t yet looked for an alternative for when the service shuts down. I might end up finally using the <a href=\"http://feverapp.com/\">Fever</a> installation I set up a while ago or even go back to <a href=\"http://www.netnewswireapp.com\">NetNewsWire</a>.</p><p>When I read on the Mac it&#8217;s usually in a browser. <a href=\"http://www.google.com/chrome\">Google Chrome</a> is my browser of choice. I&#8217;m a heavy <a href=\"http://www.pinboard.in/\">Pinboard</a> user and Chrome extensions are my favorite way of adding and searching my bookmarks.</p><p><strong>Coding:</strong></p><p>When I code a website I use <a href=\"https://www.panic.com/CODA/\">Coda 2</a> since it has smart features I still miss in other editors. I find it most helpful that Coda remembers my open tabs on a per project basis. Even more important, it remembers the split tabs where I grouped documents that are interacting with each other. It&#8217;s a great feature that I specially enjoy every time when revive an old project.</p><p>To preview websites on my mobile devices I use <a href=\"http://html.adobe.com/edge/inspect/\">Adobe&#8217;s Edge Inspect</a> and <a href=\"http://livereload.com/\">LiveReload</a>.</p><p>To store tutorials, references, books about web development and sites that inspire me I use <a href=\"http://reinventedsoftware.com/together/\">Together</a>. What I like about it is that it doesn&#8217;t use a single database file. I can drop files into specific folders and they automatically get tagged when I open Together.</p><p>If there is something to code and it is no website, then my favorite editor is <a href=\"http://www.sublimetext.com/\">Sublime Text 2</a> &mdash; if it would remember the split sets like Coda I&#8217;d instantly switch to it since it&#8217;s so highly customizable.</p><p>I also use <a href=\"http://www.git-tower.com/\">Tower</a> for managing my git repositories. Terminal and <a href=\"http://www.iterm2.com/\">iTerm</a> apps companions for my way through the shell.</p><p><strong>Designing:</strong></p><p>I&#8217;m paying Adobe to let me use their feature rich programs aka Photoshop and Illustrator.</p><p>To optimize images for the web I use <a href=\"http://jpegmini.com\">JPEGmini</a> and the hand-made <a href=\"http://imageoptim.com/\">ImageOptim</a> I wrote about in my blog.</p><p><strong>Audio:</strong></p><p>When it comes to listing I&#8217;m still undecided whether to stick with <a href=\"http://www.rdio.com/\">Rdio</a> or <a href=\"http://www.spotify.com/\">Spotify</a>. Both have drawbacks and great features.</p><p>For composing I use <a href=\"http://www.ableton.com/live\">Ableton Live</a> and <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/logicstudio/logicpro/\">Logic Pro</a> with an armada of plug-ins and virtual instruments.</p><p><strong>Miscellaneous:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.cocoatech.com/\">Path Finder</a> and Finder help me manage my files</li><li><a href=\"http://www.sparrowmailapp.com/\">Sparrow</a> is my default mail client.</li><li><a href=\"http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/TaskPaper\">TaskPaper</a>, <a href=\"http://projects.tynsoe.org/geektool/\">GeekTool</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnifocus/\">OmniFocus</a> build my GTD setup. OmniFocus is the main brain which keeps me from forgetting tasks. I prefer the Mac version over both of the iOS apps in terms of swiftness when it comes to organizing tasks.</li><li><a href=\"https://agilebits.com/onepassword\">1Password</a> is another application which is constantly open. I like to try a lot of new web services.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/\">Dropbox</a> keeps the main part of my system &mdash; be it files or preferences &mdash; in sync across all my Mac&#8217;s.</li><li>I use <a href=\"http://bjango.com/mac/istatmenus/\">iStat Menus</a> to keep an eye on my SSD&#8217;s disk space and my memory.</li><li>With <a href=\"http://myphonedesktop.com/\">myPhoneDesktop</a> and <a href=\"http://10base-t.com/macintosh-software/dropcopy/\">DropCopy Pro</a> I send files to iOS. Since my girlfriend is still running Snow Leopard, DropCopy is our go-to app for sharing files or links with each other.</li><li><a href=\"http://www.getcloudapp.com/\">CloudApp</a> is my favorite app for sharing Internet finds with my friends.</li><li><a href=\"http://flexibits.com/fantastical\">Fantastical</a> is the best way for me to get an overview of important upcoming events. It&#8217;s also the best way to add them to my calendar.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/aperture/\">Aperture</a> is my database for all personal photos.</li><li><a href=\"http://www.growl.info/\">Growl</a>, <a href=\"http://www.alarmsapp.com/\">Alarms</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.dueapp.com/\">Due</a> to remind to exercise, making a pause and to sit straight.</li><li>And… I use <a href=\"http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/\">Keyboard Maestro</a> for everything!</li></ul><p><strong>iOS &mdash; Work:</strong></p><p>On my iPhone and iPad I have about 350 apps each. A lot of them are tucked away in a folders. I keep barely-used applications around for easy access in case I really need them. A good example for rarely-used apps would be all the ones that are specific to my home town. On the iPad, however, I don&#8217;t have a lot of these specialists. But I have more folders with apps that I haven&#8217;t checked out yet. In any case, here&#8217;s what I use on a regular basis.</p><p>I write in <a href=\"http://agiletortoise.com/drafts\">Drafts</a> despite  preferring the Markdown toolbar of <a href=\"http://gokarbon.com/scratch/\">Scratch</a>. The iPad version of Drafts has one, and I&#8217;m still hoping that the iPhone gets one too some day.</p><p>If I need to make corrections to a post I open <a href=\"http://bywordapp.com/\">Byword</a> and edit the post. And while we&#8217;re at the blog, sometimes I have to open <a href=\"https://www.panic.com/prompt/\">Prompt</a> to analyze a problem or restart my Jekyll blog.</p><p>The header images for my blog are drawn in <a href=\"http://www.fiftythree.com/paper\">Paper</a>. I love its ease of use, the app is also the starting point for all of my mockups and general ideas for websites.</p><p>When I need to share files with someone I use Dropbox, ClouDrop for Cloudapp, or ClouDrop for Dropbox by <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/touchmiphone/id321133814\">TouchMyPhone</a>. If I want my screen shots on my Mac I use <a href=\"http://www.photosync-app.com/\">PhotoSync</a> since it&#8217;s faster than waiting for iCloud to sync the files in question.</p><p>For research I have couple of apps that most folks will be familiar with: <a href=\"http://albinadevelopment.com/pinbook\">Pinbook</a> and <a href=\"http://www.delibarapp.com/iphone/\">Delitouch iPhone</a> for browsing Pinboard, <a href=\"http://tapbots.com/software/tweetbot/\">Tweetbot</a>, <a href=\"http://kepner.me/apps/\">Bang On</a>, and Google Chrome.</p><p>In addition, I always have my iPhone at hand while reading &mdash; if there&#8217;s a need to clarify something I open up one of my Dictionaries. I have a couple for different purposes: linguistics ones, literature specific ones, and one for every coding language.</p><p>My RSS client of choice is <a href=\"http://reederapp.com/\">Reeder</a> on the iPhone and <a href=\"http://www.curioustimes.de/mrreader/index.html\">Mr. Reader</a> on the iPad. If I find something I like to act on or would like to link it goes into <a href=\"http://getpocket.com/\">Pocket</a>, and if it&#8217;s a longer read I send it to <a href=\"http://www.instapaper.com/iphone\">Instapaper</a> &mdash; both of these apps are jam-packed to the point that I doubt I can ever catch up with everything in there. If I&#8217;m about to continue working on another device I open the article in question with Google Chrome to ensure that I can resume where I left off.</p><p>Apart from reading feeds I also like to read books on the iPad. I collect them in my Dropbox and import them into iBooks via <a href=\"http://www.goodiware.com/goodreader.html\">GoodReader</a> or DropCopy. If it&#8217;s a shorter PDF I read it directly in GoodReader.</p><p>When I study for a test I use <a href=\"http://orangeorapple.com/Flashcards/\">Flashcards Deluxe</a>. I have a macro which formats a Markdown document of my study notes into the format that the app reads. The macro also puts the file into my Dropbox. All I have to do is to import the file and start learning.</p><p>Beforehand I admitted that I barely use my scanner. I digitalize University or office documents most of the times with <a href=\"http://readdle.com/products/scanner_pro\">Scanner Pro</a> and send them directly to my Dropbox.</p><p>While we&#8217;re still in the category of work related apps that I use most frequently, there are some classics that are hits on the iPhone for a reason. These ones are on my Homes creen:  <a href=\"http://appcubby.com/launch-center/\">LaunchCenterPro</a>, <a href=\"http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnifocus-iphone/\">OmniFocus</a>, <a href=\"http://www.sparrowmailapp.com/iphone.php\">Sparrow</a>, <a href=\"https://agilebits.com/onepassword/ios\">1Password</a>, <a href=\"http://flexibits.com/fantastical-iphone\">Fantastical</a>, and the TomTom navigation app.</p><p>I mentioned in the beginning that health plays a big role for me when it comes to work. Here&#8217;s one of my shorter morning rituals and the apps I use with it: my day starts with two glasses of water, then I put my bluetooth headphones on, fire up Spotify and select some relaxing music for my Yoga exercises. <a href=\"http://www.repeattimerapp.com/\">Repeat Timer Pro</a> is the best app I found so far for basic interval training.</p><p>To conclude this section about apps I use for working, I also want to end with Spotify since music can increase creativity and help to focus better. I often use my iPhone or iPad to play music instead of my Mac. Unlike the Mac version of Spotify the mobile app doesn&#8217;t chuck away on my upload stream. I send the audio signal to <a href=\"http://www.rogueamoeba.com/airfoil/\">Airfoil Speakers</a> on my Mac and I&#8217;m good. Furthermore, to focus while studying I have a binaural playlist on Spotify and this little collection of apps: <a href=\"http://www.dataca.com/Attractor.html\">Attractor</a>, <a href=\"http://www.redpiston.com/our_work.php\">MindWave 2</a>, and some <a href=\"http://www.teslasoftware.com/\">AmbiScience</a> apps.</p><p><strong>iOS &mdash; Everyday Life:</strong></p><p>My smartphone has alleviated my everyday life, that&#8217;s for sure. Here are some key aspects where I find it utterly useful:</p><p><a href=\"http://notesy-app.com/\">Notesy</a> is one of the most important apps on my phone. Everything that&#8217;s inside of nvALT is also in Notesy, for instance when I plan to cook something new I save the recipe in my notes folder and have the Markdown preview right in front of me. I have an array of <a href=\"http://www.dueapp.com/\">Due</a> timers for cooking and baking.</p><p>If I&#8217;m not working it is highly likely that I have my headphones on and listen to a podcast via <a href=\"http://www.downcastapp.com/\">Downcast</a> or even better, an audiobook (I&#8217;m a sucker for audiobooks).</p><p>The iPhone is also my main camera, so <a href=\"http://campl.us\">Camera+</a> and the default camera app are on my Home screen to make sure I can easily access them any time. I sold my regular cameras because the iPhone suits my needs just fine. I&#8217;m the point-and-click guy when it comes to capturing moments, and it&#8217;s enough for me.</p><p>Another thing I like to do on iOS is to remote control my Mac with <a href=\"http://www.stairways.com/iphone/\">Keyboard Maestro Control</a> or <a href=\"http://www.iteleportmobile.com/\">iTeleport</a>. Most of the time it&#8217;s nothing important but it&#8217;s a nice feature I like to use when I&#8217;m on the couch.</p><p>The last big point where the iPhone shines for me is it helps me to keep track of&#8230;</p><ul><li>my lists with <a href=\"http://listaryapp.com/\">Listary</a>;</li><li>cartoons and series I&#8217;m following with <a href=\"http://www.itvshowsapp.com/\">iTV Shows</a>;</li><li>movies I want to see in the cinema with <a href=\"http://www.taphive.com/todomovies/\">TodoMovies</a> (side note: I hope to see a <a href=\"http://letterboxd.com/\">Letterboxd</a> app some day);</li><li>apps that I want to buy with <a href=\"http://appshopper.com/\">AppShopper</a>;</li><li>the weather with <a href=\"http://www.weatherpro.eu/\">WeatherPro</a> (which has proven to be the most reliable app for Europe, but not the most beautiful), and <a href=\"http://www.rainalarmapp.com/\">RainAlarm</a> (since there is no Dark Sky for Europe).</li></ul><h4>5. How does this setup help you do your best creative work?</h4><p>At some point in my twenties I suddenly realized that I had back pain many a time, that I gained some weight, and that my mood swings were in fact a full-grown chronic depression. It was obvious that I couldn&#8217;t perform my best under these circumstances.</p><p>To fight all of the above I started to do Yoga along with some other exercises, to eat more healthy and to create a work environment which makes me happy. In the last 5 years I managed to drop the extra 22 pounds (10 kg) I gained beforehand and developed an interest in cooking which revealed that one&#8217;s own kitchen can serve better food than 90-percent of the restaurants in the close vicinity. These measures lead to fewer periods of depression which I&#8217;m very thankful for.</p><p>If you work on a desk with a monitor in front of your face from dusk till dawn, then time truly flies. I get easily distracted; I even managed to ignore my own health. By taking breaks and exercising I find myself to be more cheerful, recharged, and overall a bit healthier. It&#8217;s a wonder by all the optimizations I made to tweak my operating system that it took so long for me to recognize that my body&#8217;s &#8220;OS&#8221; also was in need of more organization and maintenance.</p><p>My point with the 3 paragraphs above is that a healthy body is the only way for me to not drop into a hole of darkness. My other tactic to reduce the likeliness of such a thing happening is to surround myself with stuff that makes me happy. That&#8217;s why I called the constituents of my playful environment &#8220;health appliances&#8221;.</p><p>To keep this system running, a good part of my setup consists of different ways to remind me to eat, exercise, and take a break. I change those reminders regularly so that I don&#8217;t get too accustomed to one set, otherwise I would sit on my Mac non-stop and forget everything around me. I don&#8217;t know the feeling of being bored when I&#8217;m in front of one of my gadgets. Combined with decent internet access they work like a creativity accelerator for me. I always find stuff to do and have a variety of lists where I gather different creative projects.</p><p>The Mac and iOS devices do a splendid job at reminding me of my goals and showing me what I could and should do next. The only glitch in the system is me, since it&#8217;s me who sometimes ignores the good advice and gets lost in a side-project.</p><h4>6. How would your ideal setup look and function?</h4><p>A 13-inch MacBook would be sufficient for me to get things done &mdash; I&#8217;ve worked with one for years. But since I&#8217;m allowed to dream a little bit, here we go:</p><p>I would love to trade in the two 24-inch displays for one larger retina display. I hope Apple has something in the pipe to can make the Retina Cinema Display work over Thunderbolt &mdash; from what I&#8217;ve read Thunderbolt could be the bottleneck there.</p><p>Particularly with regard to the high energy consumption of the Mac Pro in combination with the two monitors, I can imagine a more lightweight solution. My number one requirement would be a retina display &mdash; be it an iMac or a MacBook with a large retina Cinema Display. The next technical condition would be a multi-bay enclosures that is <em>silent</em>, affordable, and fast (think Thunderbolt) to make up for the 4 drive bays which I would leave behind. I just don&#8217;t see the latter three conditions happening at the moment.</p><p>Speaking of gadgets, here are some more realistic purchases I plan to acquire. I think an <a href=\"http://adonit.net/jot/pro/\">Adonit Jot Pro</a> might do a better job when writing things in the Papers app, and another nice addition to my setup would be the <a href=\"http://www.twelvesouth.com/products/plugbugworld/\">Twelve South PlugBug World</a>.</p><p>Besides the above mentioned, switching to a lightweight setup feels far away. Some of my gear speaks another language: my MacBook&#8217;s display for instance. The right side on my smallest Mac is malfunctioning &mdash; it flickers like crazy. Sooner or later the computer needs to get replaced. The next defect device is my bluetooth Sennheiser. I dropped it on a marble floor because the carabiner with which I attached it to my Ristretto bag snapped open while I was fumbling in the bag. I was toying with the idea of switching the brand. The problem is, I only know of one pair of bluetooth headphones that has no problems switching between multiple bluetooth devices, but it isn&#8217;t on par with the Sennheiser quality-wise. So my wish would be a good set of headphones where switching from the Mac to my iPhone or iPad is effortlessly possible. Luckily Airfoil exists and so I will swallow the bitter pill and send in my Sennheiser as soon as I have enough cash to pay for the costly repairing.</p><p>Since I talked keyboards before, if I were to buy a new MacBook, this time I would order one with a genuine US English keyboard. And in addition, after reading about <a href=\"http://shawnblanc.net/2012/06/brett-terpstras-sweet-mac-setup/\">Brett Terpstra&#8217;s switch to the bluetooth aluminum keyboard here on the Sweet Mac Setups</a>, I can picture myself trying to make the switch to a bluetooth keyboard for my desktop Mac too. I was afraid that I would miss all the lovely extra options for additional shortcuts which a numeric keypad provides, but there are other ways to work around that. A bluetooth keyboard would also work great with the iPad.</p><p>The last item on the wish list gadget-wise is a NAS. I&#8217;ve being comparing the pros and cons of a NAS vs. a Mac mini lately, and at the moment a NAS server from Synology has the best chances to be one of my next investments. Okay, since this part of Sweet Mac Setups is encouraging dreaming it would be a NAS at home and a Mac mini from Macminicolo.net (which I just can&#8217;t afford anytime soon) to have my own powerful server.</p><p>That&#8217;s about it for the gadgets. In terms of a better workflow I wish that I&#8217;d already have a more automated way to post on my blog. On the Mac it&#8217;s already happening, but my goal from the beginning was to make it work with the iPad too. I&#8217;d like to send my drawings from the Paper app to my (shared) server. Federico Viticci&#8217;s has a crazy cool Pythonista workflow, and I hope to get there too. On the server the images should get optimized, filed into my upload directory and the corresponding Markdown image links should be appended to a scratch file.</p><p>Another workflow issue I have is when I write something for University. Sometimes Markdown doesn&#8217;t cut the chase. Here, with all the footnotes, citations, annotations and references Pandoc sounds like the better solution. I definitely have to look into it (… and Scrivener).</p><p>There&#8217;s also an application wish I have had for a long time: Listary for Dropbox. I&#8217;d like to keep everything that closely resembles a note inside my nvALT folder and I still haven&#8217;t found a better list app than Listary.</p><p>Lastly, some enhancements for my work environment: I want some nice graffiti for the concrete bricks on my desk.</p><p>Almost all of the above is not really important. Like I stated in the beginning. A 13-inch MacBook is enough to get the work done. But there are things that would be great long-term investments. By far my biggest wish is a fancy desk which is adjustable in height so that I can switch from working in a chair to working on a standing desk. The best thing I come across so far is the <a href=\"http://www.anthro.com/products/elevate-adjusta\">Anthro Elevate Adjusta</a> (check out <a href=\"http://youtu.be/AeUFcGiQznw\">this</a> YoutTube video for a short demo of the basic functions).</p><p>Along the lines of a more ergonomic workspace my second biggest wish is <a href=\"http://www.sanaform-falto.de/section/products/collection/falto-organic/wip_27__________wip_37.html\">the Falto Wip 37</a>. I tested it on a trade show years ago and have fallen in love with it since.</p><p>That&#8217;s it. Sorry for being a chatterbox and breaking the character count record here on Sweet Mac Setups.</p><h3>More Sweet Setups</h3><p>Patrick&#8217;s setup is one in <a href=\"http://shawnblanc.net/sweet-mac-setups/\">a series of sweet Mac Setups</a>.</p>

It’s hooked up to a <a href=\"http://reviews.cnet.com/lcd-monitors/dell-ultrasharp-2407wfp/4505-3174_7-31899303.html\">Dell 24″ monitor</a> that’s a bit older than the Mac. The screen is still color-accurate when calibrated (with a <a href=\"http://spyder.datacolor.com/display-calibration/\">Datacolor Spyder</a>), and I’m fine with the size, but I’m dying to replace it with something more densely pixeled. A Retina desktop monitor can’t come soon enough.</p><p>I sit next to a large window, which is nice for sanity but bad for color accuracy. The windows have opaque shutters I can close when doing color critical work.</p><p>The Mac’s hard drive bays are all in use: Bay 1 is my SSD boot drive &mdash; it’s fast but small, so I have my Documents, Downloads, and Pictures folders <a href=\"http://gigaom.com/2011/04/27/how-to-create-and-use-symlinks-on-a-mac/\">symlinked</a> to a drive in Bay 2. My iTunes media is on a drive in Bay 3. And Bay 4 has a drive for scratch purposes and other temporary storage.</p><p>I have a <a href=\"http://www.wdc.com/en/products/external/desktopformac/\">Western Digital MyBook</a> that keeps backups of the drives in Bays 1 &amp; 2 via Time Machine. At some point I accumulated a second MyBook that I keep around as a <a href=\"http://macsparky.com/blog/2009/9/8/screencast-17-magic-install-disk.html\">Magic Install Disk</a> which has come in surprisingly handy.</p><p>I replaced the SuperDrive with a Blu-Ray burner even though optical media is on the decline, because I still like having a <a href=\"http://dpbestflow.org/backup/backup-overview#write\">write-once copy</a> of my photo archive as a last resort backup. I take comfort knowing it’s impossible to accidentally overwrite a file with a corrupt or altered version. So after every 25 GB of shooting, I burn a disc.</p><p>I have a <a href=\"http://drobo.com/products/index.php\">Drobo</a> (2nd generation) which holds the primary copy of my photo archive. Every photo I’ve ever shot digitally for personal or freelance work is connected live and easily accessible.</p><p>I use a <a href=\"http://www.wacom-asia.com/intuos3/\">6×8 Wacom Intuos3</a> stylus, switching between mouse and pen more or less equally depending on the task. I own an <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/keyboard/\">Apple wireless keyboard</a>, but tend to use the wired keyboard because I like having a number pad.</p><p>Both my household and business are mostly paperless. For document scanning I use a <a href=\"http://www.fujitsu.com/us/services/computing/peripherals/scanners/scansnap/s300m.html\">Fujitsu ScanSnap S300M</a>. I have a physical inbox currently backlogged with stuff to be scanned.</p><p>My monitor has neither camera nor microphone, so I use an old Logitech webcam for rare video chatting and occasional dictation. I’m much more likely to use my iPhone for video chat, usually down on the floor with my son chatting with my parents.</p><p>My secondary Mac is a Late 2011 <a href=\"http://support.apple.com/kb/sp644\">15″ MacBook Pro</a>. I don’t use it most days. It’s mainly for when I’m shooting tethered on location or traveling and need something more than an iPad.</p><p>I have a <a href=\"http://www.brother-usa.com/Printer/ModelDetail/1/hl2170w/Overview#.UUMuMFspKvU\">Brother HL-2170W</a> laser printer for document printing, and an <a href=\"http://www.epson.com/cgi-bin/Store/consumer/consDetail.jsp?oid=53540920\">Epson R2400</a> for photo printing.</p><p>I usually sit in a <a href=\"http://www.humanscale.com/products/freedom-video.cfm\">Humanscale Freedom</a> task chair (the no-headrest model) I got cheap from a company going out of business. It’s okay.</p><h4>Why this rig?</h4><p>It’s the first Mac I ever bought. Here is my <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2-UuIEOcss\">switch</a> story:</p><p>I’ve always been fairly Apple/PC ambidextrous. Our first family computer was an Apple II (well, a <a href=\"http://www.ironicsans.com/2010/02/they_dont_make_computer_manual.html\">clone</a>). Sometime in the early 90s we got a PC and I learned to use DOS and Windows. Eventually I took that PC with me to college and my parents replaced it with a Mac. When I moved to New York in 1997, just starting out on my own with a small income, I bought another PC. I didn’t think Macs were as affordable, and I already had a lot of Windows software I would need to buy again for the Mac, so a PC worked well for me.</p><p>At the same time, I started working in the photo studio at <a href=\"http://christies.com/\">Christie’s</a> auction house. They had just transitioned to a fully digital workflow, a very rare thing in 1997. They were using Macs, so that’s what I used by day, and then went home to my Windows machine. Eventually I left Christie’s to become the staff photographer at <a href=\"http://www.polo.com/\">Polo Ralph Lauren</a> which insisted I used Windows for corporate reasons. But I continued to be adept at both platforms.</p><p>In 2007, I decided to quit my cushy life as a staff photographer and go freelance. I updated my computer to the latest, fastest, and greatest Dell computer I could afford, and it came with the latest and greatest version of Windows: Vista. It was garbage. I hated everything about it.</p><p>2007 is also when I moved in with my soon-to-be wife, a graphic designer who had a Mac. Watching her use OS X while I struggled with Vista made it harder to tolerate my own computer. Software for the Mac was more abundant than ever, and the games I used to play on the PC were less important to me.</p><p>So in early 2008 I took the plunge. I’d had a good first year as a freelancer, so I could afford to trade up. I got rid of the Vista machine and went all-in with the Mac described above. I kept the Dell monitor. Apple’s switch to Intel gave me confidence that if I really needed a Windows application I couldn’t replace on the Mac I could still run it in a Virtual Machine, and that made the switch easy. I haven’t looked back.</p><h4>What software do you use and for what do you use it?</h4><p>Specific to my work:</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom.html\">Lightroom</a> for the majority of my photo image editing and maintaining my archive.</li><li><a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html\">Photoshop</a> for retouching, but less and less as Lightroom gains more powerful non-destructive capabilities that use all the photo’s raw data.</li><li>Since I do a lot of video these days, I recently updated to the entire <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/creativesuite/mastercollection.html\">Adobe CS6 Master Collection</a> and use <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html\">Adobe Premiere Pro</a>.

It&#8217;s hooked up to a <a href=\"http://reviews.cnet.com/lcd-monitors/dell-ultrasharp-2407wfp/4505-3174_7-31899303.html\">Dell 24&#8243; monitor</a> that&#8217;s a bit older than the Mac. The screen is still color-accurate when calibrated (with a <a href=\"http://spyder.datacolor.com/display-calibration/\">Datacolor Spyder</a>), and I&#8217;m fine with the size, but I&#8217;m dying to replace it with something more densely pixeled. A Retina desktop monitor can&#8217;t come soon enough.</p><p>I sit next to a large window, which is nice for sanity but bad for color accuracy. The windows have opaque shutters I can close when doing color critical work.</p><p>The Mac&#8217;s hard drive bays are all in use: Bay 1 is my SSD boot drive &mdash; it&#8217;s fast but small, so I have my Documents, Downloads, and Pictures folders <a href=\"http://gigaom.com/2011/04/27/how-to-create-and-use-symlinks-on-a-mac/\">symlinked</a> to a drive in Bay 2. My iTunes media is on a drive in Bay 3. And Bay 4 has a drive for scratch purposes and other temporary storage.</p><p>I have a <a href=\"http://www.wdc.com/en/products/external/desktopformac/\">Western Digital MyBook</a> that keeps backups of the drives in Bays 1 &amp; 2 via Time Machine. At some point I accumulated a second MyBook that I keep around as a <a href=\"http://macsparky.com/blog/2009/9/8/screencast-17-magic-install-disk.html\">Magic Install Disk</a> which has come in surprisingly handy.</p><p>I replaced the SuperDrive with a Blu-Ray burner even though optical media is on the decline, because I still like having a <a href=\"http://dpbestflow.org/backup/backup-overview#write\">write-once copy</a> of my photo archive as a last resort backup. I take comfort knowing it&#8217;s impossible to accidentally overwrite a file with a corrupt or altered version. So after every 25 GB of shooting, I burn a disc.</p><p>I have a <a href=\"http://drobo.com/products/index.php\">Drobo</a> (2nd generation) which holds the primary copy of my photo archive. Every photo I&#8217;ve ever shot digitally for personal or freelance work is connected live and easily accessible.</p><p>I use a <a href=\"http://www.wacom-asia.com/intuos3/\">6&#215;8 Wacom Intuos3</a> stylus, switching between mouse and pen more or less equally depending on the task. I own an <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/keyboard/\">Apple wireless keyboard</a>, but tend to use the wired keyboard because I like having a number pad.</p><p>Both my household and business are mostly paperless. For document scanning I use a <a href=\"http://www.fujitsu.com/us/services/computing/peripherals/scanners/scansnap/s300m.html\">Fujitsu ScanSnap S300M</a>. I have a physical inbox currently backlogged with stuff to be scanned.</p><p>My monitor has neither camera nor microphone, so I use an old Logitech webcam for rare video chatting and occasional dictation. I&#8217;m much more likely to use my iPhone for video chat, usually down on the floor with my son chatting with my parents.</p><p>My secondary Mac is a Late 2011 <a href=\"http://support.apple.com/kb/sp644\">15&#8243; MacBook Pro</a>. I don&#8217;t use it most days. It&#8217;s mainly for when I&#8217;m shooting tethered on location or traveling and need something more than an iPad.</p><p>I have a <a href=\"http://www.brother-usa.com/Printer/ModelDetail/1/hl2170w/Overview#.UUMuMFspKvU\">Brother HL-2170W</a> laser printer for document printing, and an <a href=\"http://www.epson.com/cgi-bin/Store/consumer/consDetail.jsp?oid=53540920\">Epson R2400</a> for photo printing.</p><p>I usually sit in a <a href=\"http://www.humanscale.com/products/freedom-video.cfm\">Humanscale Freedom</a> task chair (the no-headrest model) I got cheap from a company going out of business. It&#8217;s okay.</p><h4>Why this rig?</h4><p>It&#8217;s the first Mac I ever bought. Here is my <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2-UuIEOcss\">switch</a> story:</p><p>I&#8217;ve always been fairly Apple/PC ambidextrous. Our first family computer was an Apple II (well, a <a href=\"http://www.ironicsans.com/2010/02/they_dont_make_computer_manual.html\">clone</a>). Sometime in the early 90s we got a PC and I learned to use DOS and Windows. Eventually I took that PC with me to college and my parents replaced it with a Mac. When I moved to New York in 1997, just starting out on my own with a small income, I bought another PC. I didn&#8217;t think Macs were as affordable, and I already had a lot of Windows software I would need to buy again for the Mac, so a PC worked well for me.</p><p>At the same time, I started working in the photo studio at <a href=\"http://christies.com/\">Christie&#8217;s</a> auction house. They had just transitioned to a fully digital workflow, a very rare thing in 1997. They were using Macs, so that&#8217;s what I used by day, and then went home to my Windows machine. Eventually I left Christie&#8217;s to become the staff photographer at <a href=\"http://www.polo.com/\">Polo Ralph Lauren</a> which insisted I used Windows for corporate reasons. But I continued to be adept at both platforms.</p><p>In 2007, I decided to quit my cushy life as a staff photographer and go freelance. I updated my computer to the latest, fastest, and greatest Dell computer I could afford, and it came with the latest and greatest version of Windows: Vista. It was garbage. I hated everything about it.</p><p>2007 is also when I moved in with my soon-to-be wife, a graphic designer who had a Mac. Watching her use OS X while I struggled with Vista made it harder to tolerate my own computer. Software for the Mac was more abundant than ever, and the games I used to play on the PC were less important to me.</p><p>So in early 2008 I took the plunge. I&#8217;d had a good first year as a freelancer, so I could afford to trade up. I got rid of the Vista machine and went all-in with the Mac described above. I kept the Dell monitor. Apple&#8217;s switch to Intel gave me confidence that if I really needed a Windows application I couldn&#8217;t replace on the Mac I could still run it in a Virtual Machine, and that made the switch easy. I haven&#8217;t looked back.</p><h4>What software do you use and for what do you use it?</h4><p>Specific to my work:</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom.html\">Lightroom</a> for the majority of my photo image editing and maintaining my archive.</li><li><a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html\">Photoshop</a> for retouching, but less and less as Lightroom gains more powerful non-destructive capabilities that use all the photo&#8217;s raw data.</li><li>Since I do a lot of video these days, I recently updated to the entire <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/creativesuite/mastercollection.html\">Adobe CS6 Master Collection</a> and use <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html\">Adobe Premiere Pro</a>. I had been using Final Cut Pro but found Premiere to be more stable and faster, despite some nice features I miss from FCP. I purchased the full version instead of getting a Creative Cloud subscription.</li><li><a href=\"http://www.parallels.com/\">Parallels</a> so I can use <a href=\"http://quickbooks.intuit.com/\">QuickBooks</a> for Windows, to make things easier for my accountant.</li></ul><p>More generally useful apps I use.

Unubiquitious computing demands have inspired developers to rush to build unconnected communities. The new <em>connected</em> is to be <em>disconnected</em>. Deadspots are the new hotspots.</p></blockquote><p>What I like about Rego versus Gowalla, Path, Foursquare, and others, is that Rego is selectively social. It’s not a social network, but I can share any of my places if I want.</p><p>If I want to share my favorite coffee shop or the trailhead to a cool 4×4 trail, then I can. Any place I have in Rego I can choose to share.</p><p>Rego does this by creating a unique URL of my shared place that includes the name and location, and, if I want, any of the images or notes that I’ve added to that place.</p><p><img class=\"leftb\" src=\"http://shawnblanc.net.s3.amazonaws.com/img/rego-sharing.jpg\" height=\"568\" width=\"320\" title=\"Sharing a place in Rego\" alt=\"Sharing a place in Rego\" /></p><p>For example, <a href=\"http://www.regoapp.com/p/lI8luagMxC\">here’s a link to Quay Coffee</a>, a place I have in my Rego. If you click that link, you’ll see the location of Quay as well as a picture I took earlier this week and a note I added to that image.</p><p>I can share the Quay link any way I would share any other link &mdash; I can email it, text message it, tweet it, etc. &mdash; but since Rego is not a social network, I don’t have to manage incoming follower requests deciding who I want to allow to see <em>all</em> the places I bookmark. I <em>choose</em> what places I want to share, and even who I share them with.</p><p>That’s what I mean by Rego being selectively social &mdash; there are dozens of other places I have in Rego that are known only to me.</p><h4>Adding Places</h4><p>Adding a place in Rego is a snap. As well it should be, considering it’s the chief function of the app.</p><p>You launch the app, and the map finds your location. You then tap the “plus” icon in the upper right corner, enter the name of the place you’re adding, and hit Save.</p><p>Once you’ve added a new place, you can then close Rego and return to doing whatever you were doing earlier. Or you can add more information to your place such as images and notes, or add it to a collection (even multiple collections).</p><p>In my <a href=\"http://shawnblanc.net/2010/08/gowalla/\">review of Gowalla</a> a few years ago, I listed out a few of the things I loved most (such as building trips) as well as things I most wished were a part of the app (such as adding a location without physically being in that spot). Rego has answers for both of these things.</p><p>Because Rego lets you put places into multiple collections I can easily build trips and lists. And since Rego lets you add a location even if you’re not physically standing there with your iPhone in hand, I can add places I <em>want</em> to visit, in addition to adding places I’ve been to but not since I installed Rego.</p><p>To add a place you aren’t currently at you simply move the map around until the cross hairs are where you want them to be. Then you tap the “plus” button to add the place and a red pin will drop right where the crosshairs were pointed.</p><p>Unfortunately there is no ability to search for a place. Which means: (a) there is no auto-suggest for the location you’re currently at; and (b) when adding a place that is somewhere other than your current location, you kinda have to eyeball it with the crosshairs and the map (I’m told that the 1.1 update of Rego will use Foursquare’s search API to help you find and add locations easier).</p><h4>Collections</h4><p>As I mentioned above, once you’ve added a place, it consists of three things: (1) the location, (2) any photos and text notes you want to add to your place, and (3) a collection.</p><p>Collections are just lists. A place can be added to multiple collections. So <a href=\"http://www.regoapp.com/p/d95fMe1lnr\">my favorite coffee shop</a> can be placed in my “Coffee Joints” collection, as well as my “Faves” collection, and even my “Colorado Summer Vacation” collection if I want.</p><p>Earlier this week I spent the afternoon and drove around to each of my favorite coffee shops in Kansas City. These coffee shops are all in a collection within my Rego app called “Coffee Joints”:</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.regoapp.com/p/lI8luagMxC\">Quay</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.regoapp.com/p/GGwu1Sng5l\">Broadway Cafe</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.regoapp.com/p/RTzRVzqNm6\">Oddly Correct</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.regoapp.com/p/5vwv9F880Y\">Roasterie in Leawood</a> (and <a href=\"http://www.regoapp.com/p/3k80l2ARjL\">in Brookside</a>)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.regoapp.com/p/DQb7aNxnzm\">Cafe Main</a></li></ul><p>I’ve also started building a collection of my favorite hole-in-the-wall BBQ spots in Kansas City.<a class=\"fn\" href=\"#XXX_fn1\" id=\"XXX_fnr1\">1</a></p><p>It would be great to be able to share an entire collection if I wanted to. Have an acquaintance passing through and they want to know where to get the best Americano and the best pulled pork sandwich? <em>Here, check out these two lists. You can’t go wrong at any of these joints.</em><a class=\"fn\" href=\"#XXX_fn2\" id=\"XXX_fnr2\">2</a> And since I can also chose to share any notes I’ve taken of a place, I can include recommendations for what to order.<a class=\"fn\" href=\"#XXX_fn3\" id=\"XXX_fnr3\">3</a></p><p>All this while having the freedom to keep my other places (such as my home, my in-law’s home, a vacation rental, and a favorite camping spot) completely to myself.</p><p>If you’ve clicked on one of the above coffee shop links, you’ll have noticed that when someone views a shared location they can see all the info I’ve chosen to share about that location (I can <em>just</em> share the pin drop if I want to &mdash; I don’t have to share any of my images or notes related to that location).</p><p>When viewing a shared location, if you have Rego installed on your iPhone, you can import the location and notes to your own list of places. If you’re viewing the place on an iPad or Mac that won’t have Rego installed, or if you’re on your iPhone and just don’t want to import the location, a link appears over top of the map to open the location in Google maps.</p><h4>Planning a Trip</h4><p>Since you can add locations you’re not physically at, you can use Rego to plan a trip &mdash; dropping pins at all the places you want to visit, and even adding notes about that place.</p><p>Unfortunately, since Rego does not yet have the ability to search for a place, you’ll have to eyeball it when adding places. If you’ve got a lot of trails, restaurants, and other landmarks you want to visit next time you’re, say, in the Rocky Mountains, you may find building out an entire week’s worth of excursions takes a bit of time.</p><p>I’ve built a collection for my Summer vacation to the Rocky Mountains, which includes a few restaurants we want to visit and some 4×4 trails we want to hit. I can then use Rego to instantly pull up the places we want to visit and get directions.</p><p>To get directions to a place, tap the standard iOS “Share” icon in the top right corner. Then select “Open In…” and Rego will give you the option to open the location in Apple Maps, as well as Google Maps and/or the TomTom app if you have those installed. Then, you can use your way-finding app of choice to get directions to your place.</p><p>Also worth noting, is that you can reorient the map by tapping and holding. When you do this a purple pin will drop and then all the locations in Rego will be sorted by distance from the purple pin rather than from your current location. This can be helpful for, say, getting an idea of the proximity all your planned excursions are from where you’ll be staying.</p><h4>Data Export</h4><p>Alas, currently there is no way to get your data out of Rego. Though all your info is stored locally on your iPhone, if you ever decide to stop using Rego there’s no way to get your data out. I’m told that export is a feature they are working on and will be added to a future release.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Rego is <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/rego-bookmark-your-favorite/id603544163?mt=8\">available now</a> as a free download, and allows you to add up to 10 places. To add more places than that, there is a $2.99 in-app purchase (which is currently on a launch-price sale of $0.99). This is Rego’s way of offering a “try before you buy” version.</p><p>While I do see some overlap between how one might use both Rego and Day One &mdash; because both allow you to log “Moments” with images, notes, and your location &mdash; I see both as being useful.</p><p>For me, Rego is the place where I log my favorite spots, recommended spots, and spots I want to visit. And sure, an image or two can be added to give some flair to the saved location entry, but for recording memories, I’ll continue to use Day One.</p><p>All in all, Rego 1.0 is a fantastic app with some great features and functionality. The lack of social features mean it’s not one more app you have to “manage” and “check in” on. It’s an app you use if and when you want &mdash; it doesn’t bug you to use it all the time. This is precisely what I like so much about it.</p><div class=\"footnotes\"><hr /><ol><li id=\"XXX_fn1\">Which will include Okie Joe’s, L.C.’s, Arthur Bryant’s, and (for those who need a place with a nice atmosphere) Jack Stack. <a href=\"#XXX_fnr1\" title=\"Back To Top\">↵</a></li><li id=\"XXX_fn2\">Of course, a situation like the above is exactly where an app like Foursquare would shine. The social aspect of the app makes it easy to aggregate the “most popular” locations. But I’ve never had trouble getting a recommendation by asking for one on Twitter or looking on Yelp. <a href=\"#XXX_fnr2\" title=\"Back To Top\">↵</a></li><li id=\"XXX_fn3\">At Broadway, get espresso. At Quay (pronounce it “key”), get a pour over. At Okie Joe’s, get the Z-Man. At L.C.’s, get ribs, order in a hurry, and pay with cash. <a href=\"#XXX_fnr3\" title=\"Back To Top\">↵</a></li></ol></div>" "http://shawnblanc.net/2013/03/rego-review/" (20809 51374) new 25 nil nil ((title nil "✚ Review: Rego, the New Place for All Your Places") (link nil "http://shawnblanc.net/2013/03/rego-review/") (comments nil "http://shawnblanc.net/2013/03/rego-review/#comments") (pubDate nil "Wed, 20 Mar 2013 14:33:18 +0000") (dc:creator nil "Shawn Blanc") (category nil "Articles") (category nil "Reviews") (guid ((isPermaLink .

I <em>choose</em> what places I want to share, and even who I share them with.</p><p>That&#8217;s what I mean by Rego being selectively social &mdash; there are dozens of other places I have in Rego that are known only to me.</p><h4>Adding Places</h4><p>Adding a place in Rego is a snap. As well it should be, considering it&#8217;s the chief function of the app.</p><p>You launch the app, and the map finds your location. You then tap the &#8220;plus&#8221; icon in the upper right corner, enter the name of the place you&#8217;re adding, and hit Save.</p><p>Once you&#8217;ve added a new place, you can then close Rego and return to doing whatever you were doing earlier. Or you can add more information to your place such as images and notes, or add it to a collection (even multiple collections).</p><p>In my <a href=\"http://shawnblanc.net/2010/08/gowalla/\">review of Gowalla</a> a few years ago, I listed out a few of the things I loved most (such as building trips) as well as things I most wished were a part of the app (such as adding a location without physically being in that spot). Rego has answers for both of these things.</p><p>Because Rego lets you put places into multiple collections I can easily build trips and lists. And since Rego lets you add a location even if you&#8217;re not physically standing there with your iPhone in hand, I can add places I <em>want</em> to visit, in addition to adding places I&#8217;ve been to but not since I installed Rego.</p><p>To add a place you aren&#8217;t currently at you simply move the map around until the cross hairs are where you want them to be. Then you tap the &#8220;plus&#8221; button to add the place and a red pin will drop right where the crosshairs were pointed.</p><p>Unfortunately there is no ability to search for a place. Which means: (a) there is no auto-suggest for the location you&#8217;re currently at; and (b) when adding a place that is somewhere other than your current location, you kinda have to eyeball it with the crosshairs and the map (I&#8217;m told that the 1.1 update of Rego will use Foursquare&#8217;s search API to help you find and add locations easier).</p><h4>Collections</h4><p>As I mentioned above, once you&#8217;ve added a place, it consists of three things: (1) the location, (2) any photos and text notes you want to add to your place, and (3) a collection.</p><p>Collections are just lists. A place can be added to multiple collections. So <a href=\"http://www.regoapp.com/p/d95fMe1lnr\">my favorite coffee shop</a> can be placed in my &#8220;Coffee Joints&#8221; collection, as well as my &#8220;Faves&#8221; collection, and even my &#8220;Colorado Summer Vacation&#8221; collection if I want.</p><p>Earlier this week I spent the afternoon and drove around to each of my favorite coffee shops in Kansas City. These coffee shops are all in a collection within my Rego app called &#8220;Coffee Joints&#8221;:</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.regoapp.com/p/lI8luagMxC\">Quay</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.regoapp.com/p/GGwu1Sng5l\">Broadway Cafe</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.regoapp.com/p/RTzRVzqNm6\">Oddly Correct</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.regoapp.com/p/5vwv9F880Y\">Roasterie in Leawood</a> (and <a href=\"http://www.regoapp.com/p/3k80l2ARjL\">in Brookside</a>)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.regoapp.com/p/DQb7aNxnzm\">Cafe Main</a></li></ul><p>I&#8217;ve also started building a collection of my favorite hole-in-the-wall BBQ spots in Kansas City.<a class=\"fn\" href=\"#XXX_fn1\" id=\"XXX_fnr1\">1</a></p><p>It would be great to be able to share an entire collection if I wanted to. Have an acquaintance passing through and they want to know where to get the best Americano and the best pulled pork sandwich? <em>Here, check out these two lists. You can&#8217;t go wrong at any of these joints.</em><a class=\"fn\" href=\"#XXX_fn2\" id=\"XXX_fnr2\">2</a> And since I can also chose to share any notes I&#8217;ve taken of a place, I can include recommendations for what to order.<a class=\"fn\" href=\"#XXX_fn3\" id=\"XXX_fnr3\">3</a></p><p>All this while having the freedom to keep my other places (such as my home, my in-law&#8217;s home, a vacation rental, and a favorite camping spot) completely to myself.</p><p>If you&#8217;ve clicked on one of the above coffee shop links, you&#8217;ll have noticed that when someone views a shared location they can see all the info I&#8217;ve chosen to share about that location (I can <em>just</em> share the pin drop if I want to &mdash; I don&#8217;t have to share any of my images or notes related to that location).</p><p>When viewing a shared location, if you have Rego installed on your iPhone, you can import the location and notes to your own list of places. If you&#8217;re viewing the place on an iPad or Mac that won&#8217;t have Rego installed, or if you&#8217;re on your iPhone and just don&#8217;t want to import the location, a link appears over top of the map to open the location in Google maps.</p><h4>Planning a Trip</h4><p>Since you can add locations you&#8217;re not physically at, you can use Rego to plan a trip &mdash; dropping pins at all the places you want to visit, and even adding notes about that place.</p><p>Unfortunately, since Rego does not yet have the ability to search for a place, you&#8217;ll have to eyeball it when adding places. If you&#8217;ve got a lot of trails, restaurants, and other landmarks you want to visit next time you&#8217;re, say, in the Rocky Mountains, you may find building out an entire week&#8217;s worth of excursions takes a bit of time.</p><p>I&#8217;ve built a collection for my Summer vacation to the Rocky Mountains, which includes a few restaurants we want to visit and some 4&#215;4 trails we want to hit. I can then use Rego to instantly pull up the places we want to visit and get directions.</p><p>To get directions to a place, tap the standard iOS &#8220;Share&#8221; icon in the top right corner. Then select &#8220;Open In&#8230;&#8221; and Rego will give you the option to open the location in Apple Maps, as well as Google Maps and/or the TomTom app if you have those installed. Then, you can use your way-finding app of choice to get directions to your place.</p><p>Also worth noting, is that you can reorient the map by tapping and holding. When you do this a purple pin will drop and then all the locations in Rego will be sorted by distance from the purple pin rather than from your current location. This can be helpful for, say, getting an idea of the proximity all your planned excursions are from where you&#8217;ll be staying.</p><h4>Data Export</h4><p>Alas, currently there is no way to get your data out of Rego. Though all your info is stored locally on your iPhone, if you ever decide to stop using Rego there&#8217;s no way to get your data out. I&#8217;m told that export is a feature they are working on and will be added to a future release.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Rego is <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/rego-bookmark-your-favorite/id603544163?mt=8\">available now</a> as a free download, and allows you to add up to 10 places. To add more places than that, there is a $2.99 in-app purchase (which is currently on a launch-price sale of $0.99). This is Rego&#8217;s way of offering a &#8220;try before you buy&#8221; version.</p><p>While I do see some overlap between how one might use both Rego and Day One &mdash; because both allow you to log &#8220;Moments&#8221; with images, notes, and your location &mdash; I see both as being useful.</p><p>For me, Rego is the place where I log my favorite spots, recommended spots, and spots I want to visit. And sure, an image or two can be added to give some flair to the saved location entry, but for recording memories, I&#8217;ll continue to use Day One.</p><p>All in all, Rego 1.0 is a fantastic app with some great features and functionality. The lack of social features mean it&#8217;s not one more app you have to &#8220;manage&#8221; and &#8220;check in&#8221; on. It&#8217;s an app you use if and when you want &mdash; it doesn&#8217;t bug you to use it all the time. This is precisely what I like so much about it.</p><div class=\"footnotes\"><hr /><ol><li id=\"XXX_fn1\">Which will include Okie Joe&#8217;s, L.C.&#8217;s, Arthur Bryant&#8217;s, and (for those who need a place with a nice atmosphere) Jack Stack. <a href=\"#XXX_fnr1\" title=\"Back To Top\">&#8629;</a></li><li id=\"XXX_fn2\">Of course, a situation like the above is exactly where an app like Foursquare would shine. The social aspect of the app makes it easy to aggregate the &#8220;most popular&#8221; locations. But I&#8217;ve never had trouble getting a recommendation by asking for one on Twitter or looking on Yelp. <a href=\"#XXX_fnr2\" title=\"Back To Top\">&#8629;</a></li><li id=\"XXX_fn3\">At Broadway, get espresso. At Quay (pronounce it &#8220;key&#8221;), get a pour over. At Okie Joe&#8217;s, get the Z-Man. At L.C.&#8217;s, get ribs, order in a hurry, and pay with cash. <a href=\"#XXX_fnr3\" title=\"Back To Top\">&#8629;</a></li></ol></div>
