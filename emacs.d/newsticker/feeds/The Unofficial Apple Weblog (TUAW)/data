	Since the App Store opened its virtual doors, we've seen a lot of \"micro\" versions of larger genres, including platformers and RPGs. The iPhone lends itself to smaller, quicker experiences, and so a lot of developers have boiled down some very large game styles into much smaller forms. <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/slayin/id548580856?mt=8\">Slayin</a> is essentially a very boiled-down fantasy role-playing game, and it's probably one of the most charming games of this type I've ever seen.</p><p>
	The idea is ingenious. You play as a hero who constantly moving back and forth across the screen, facing endless waves of enemies and bosses. There's just one rule: Anything that touches your outstretched sword gets hurt, and anything that touches you hurts you. There are buttons to switch your direction and jump, and that's it. It's up to you to avoid enemies when you can.</p><p>
	It's incredibly fun to just cut a swath through the first few waves of blobs, murdering them for gold and XP as you go, but later enemies and bosses get tougher, requiring precise timing and dextrous moves.</p><p>
	Fortunately, this is also a full-fledged RPG, in that you level up as you earn XP, and there are occasional pop-up shops that let you buy items and recharge your health. The graphics on this one are simple, but so darn cute, and there's a surprising amount of depth in which weapon you choose to hold out in front of you. There are also missions to beat each playthrough and extra classes to unlock, so there's quite a bit to do here despite the game's simple premise.</p><p><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/slayin/id548580856?mt=8\">Slayin</a> is an absolute charm -- I opened it up not knowing what to expect, and it won me over almost immediately. It's available on the App Store this week for just US$0.99.</p><p style=\"padding:5px;clear:both;\"><a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2013/04/05/daily-iphone-app-slayin-is-an-adorable-microrpg/\">Daily iPhone App: Slayin is an adorable microRPG</a> originally appeared on <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com\">TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog</a> on Fri, 05 Apr 2013 15:30:00 EST.

	Spring is here in the US. My <a href=\"http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/index.jsp?c_id=chc\">Cubs</a> are losing, and that must mean it's finally time for baseball season! <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2013/02/22/mlb-com-at-bat-ready-to-play-ball-for-2013-season/\">MLB's official At Bat app</a> is already out in the App Store if you want to listen to the real thing, but if you would rather have your pitching and hitting simulated, Out of the Park Baseball has you covered. The <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/iootp-baseball-2013/id597133395?mt=8\">revered baseball sim's iOS version</a> has already been updated with the 2013 roster, and <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ootp-baseball-13/id504501297?mt=12\">the Mac version</a> is set to get updated on April 15.</p><p>
	Out of the Park Baseball is a great game for baseball fans, but of course it's all about the managing and simulation. If you want to actually play the game directly, it's probably not what you're looking for. For that, you'll have to wait.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12pt;\">There are </span><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/9-innings-2013-pro-baseball/id530061728?mt=8\" style=\"font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12pt;\">a few baseball games</a><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12pt;\"> out on the App Store, but they're either not full action baseball games or they're not yet updated with the 2013 rosters. MLB 13: The Show has </span><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLB_13:_The_Show\" style=\"font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12pt;\">received solid reviews</a><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12pt;\"> on the PS3, but considering that the game's made by Sony, there's not likely to be a version on the App Store anytime soon. So OotP may be the way to go for your baseball simulation, and then you can get your hitting and pitching practice in by actually going outside. Play ball!</span></p><p style=\"padding:5px;clear:both;\"><a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2013/04/05/out-of-the-park-baseball-gets-updated-for-the-new-season/\">Out of the Park Baseball gets updated for the new season</a> originally appeared on <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com\">TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog</a> on Fri, 05 Apr 2013 14:30:00 EST.

	Google realizes the importance of its Drive online file storage service in our always-on, always-connected world. To make Drive better for users and developers alike, Google <a href=\"http://googleappsdeveloper.blogspot.jp/2013/04/more-ways-for-apps-to-write-to-drive.html\">has added two new features</a>, app data folders and custom properties, to its Drive SDK.</p><p>
	The <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/drive/appdata\">app data folder</a> serves as a hidden storage space that developers can use to store configuration files and other important app data that shouldn't be changed by the user. Files stored within an app data folder are hidden from both the user and from other apps. Only your app can see what is stored within this location.

	Also, developers now can use their app to add <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/drive/properties\">custom properties</a> to a Drive file and then track that property.

The news comes courtesy of Florian Mueller of FOSS Patents who was in the courtroom observing the proceedings in question.</p><blockquote><p>
		Samsung and Google's Motorola Mobility have just scored a win over a famous Apple user interface patent. The Bundespatentgericht, Germany's Federal Patent Court, ruled that all claims of EP1964022 on \"unlocking a device by performing gestures on an unlock image\" are invalid as granted, and additionally held that none of the 14 amendments proposed by Apple could salvage the patent.</p></blockquote><p><iframe allowfullscreen=\" \" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/8JZBLjxPBUU\" width=\"420\"></iframe></p><p>
	Apple, of course, plans to appeal.</p><p>
	A question worth posing, however, is to what extent does this matter anymore?</p><p>
	As Mueller points out, Apple's slide to unlock function is today much more famous than it is a strategic feature. Note that Apple's slide to unlock patent doesn't embody every multitouch unlocking gesture and that many companies have developed alternatives that skirt around Apple's patent.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"German Court finds Apple's 'slide to unlock' patent invalid\" data-src-height=\"312\" data-src-width=\"456\" src=\"http://www.blogcdn.com/www.tuaw.com/media/2013/04/slide-to-unlock-drawling.jpg\" style=\"margin:4px\" /></p><p>
	Mueller also points out a fundamental difference between patent law in the US and patent law in Europe. Put simply, the patent requirements in Europe are more stringent to the extent that they are granted for technical solutions to technical problems.</p><p>
	\"In this case,\" Mueller writes, \"the mere fact that a sliding gesture has a visual representation was not deemed to constitute a technical innovation worthy of patent protection.\"</p><p>
	The death blow for Apple's slide to unlock patent was likely a Swedish phone called the Neonode N1m that launched well before the iPhone and featured its own slide to unlock implementation. The N1m was released in 2005 while Apple's own patent for slide to unlock wasn't filed until December of 2005.</p><p><iframe allowfullscreen=\" \" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/Tj-KS2kfIr0?rel=0\" width=\"420\"></iframe></p><p>
	Skip ahead to about 3:58 into the video and you'll see something very familiar.</p><p>
	Incidentally, a Dutch Court also found Apple's slide to unlock patent invalid because of the Neonode N1m.</p><p>
	When Steve Jobs first introduced the iPhone, he confidently went over some of its unique features and boldly exclaimed, \"and boy have we patented it!\" Yet here Apple is, still battling over iPhone patents.</p><p style=\"padding:5px;clear:both;\"><a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2013/04/05/german-court-finds-apples-slide-to-unlock-patent-invalid/\">German Court finds Apple's 'slide to unlock' patent invalid</a> originally appeared on <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com\">TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog</a> on Fri, 05 Apr 2013 11:30:00 EST.

	Yesterday around the TUAW water cooler a number of us expressed our love of <a href=\"http://www.dueapp.com\">Due</a>, an app for Mac and iOS that is basically a simple timer/reminder application (my <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2011/03/03/due-a-simple-beautiful-wonderful-reminder-app-for-ios-devices/\">original review here</a>). After trying dozens of timer apps, I think Due wins for a number of features that make it stand out from a very crowded field. After all, your iDevice comes with a timer in the Clock app, and there's Apple's Reminders app. While Reminders syncs with iCloud, your alarms in the Clock app do not. Due can help you stay focused and never overcook a boiling egg again.</p><p>
	Due's interface is simple as can be. There are three views: Reminders, Timers and Logged Reminders. You can quickly set a reminder for later in the day, or whenever. Due accepts natural language instructions, so you could say \"next Thursday at 1 PM\" and it'll set a reminder alarm for just that. Note that Due doesn't integrate with the built-in Reminders app, so I'm only referring to reminders (lower case) within Due itself.</p><p>
	Once a reminder has gone off or you check it off manually, those go into Logged Reminders. This is handy if you need to recall what you did or if you need to remind yourself of the same thing again, later.</p><p>
	I tend to use the timer function more frequently (as I use my calendar for appointments and OmniFocus for repeating tasks and \"to do\" items). I have a 25-minute timer for Pomodoros, a 5-minute timer for breaks and a couple of others for things I need to do at some point in the day, but things which require me to focus on just that thing for an allotted amount of time. By doing this, I help my squirrel-like brain stay focused on some critical tasks throughout the day, but it also helps me be flexible enough to not dread going out of being flexible in my daily schedule (more on this in next week's <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/tag/productivity/\">Productivity Tip</a>).</p><p>
	Best of all, Due has just the right number of preferences. From changing sounds to setting a snooze time, Due can be as intrusive or quiet as you like. You can even change the alarms to use Notification Center or Growl -- handy especially if you use something like <a href=\"http://www.prowlapp.com\">Prowl</a>. I particularly like the option to \"suppress alerts on launch and wake\" because I hate opening my Mac to have 30 alarms from past events going off all at once. Is it just me or is that \"throw a million notifications at me on wake\" thing seem a very obtrusive, Windows 98-like behavior? But I digress.</p><p>
	Due is a rock-solid, beautifully designed app. iCloud sync works flawlessly (you can also use Dropbox) across my Macs and iDevices, meaning I always have what I need where I need it. Most importantly, Due keeps me focused on doing things, and not setting myself up to do things, which is precisely what technology should be doing. You can get the <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/due/id524373870?mt=12\">Mac app here</a> or the <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/due-super-fast-reminders-reusable/id390017969?mt=8\">iOS version here</a>.</p><p style=\"padding:5px;clear:both;\"><a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2013/04/05/friday-favorite-due/\">Friday Favorite: Due</a> originally appeared on <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com\">TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog</a> on Fri, 05 Apr 2013 10:30:00 EST.

	Ready to <a href=\"http://www.t-mobile.com/shop/phones/\">think pink</a>? Scrappy fourth-place US cell carrier <a href=\"http://www.t-mobile.com/shop/phones/\">T-Mobile</a> is eager to serve; the company's <a href=\"http://www.t-mobile.com/shop/phones/\">pre-order run for the iPhone 5 has launched today</a>. Phones will ship to customers on April 12.</p><p>
	Last week, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2013/03/26/iphone-5-att-aws-unlocked-plans-t-mobile/\">Engadget confirmed</a> that the T-Mobile model of the iPhone 5 -- which will be available <em>unlocked</em> from Apple -- carries the same A1428 model number as the current AT&amp;T / GSM domestic model.</p><p>
	There is a critical tweak, however, for the new carrier: <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2013/03/26/iphone-5-att-aws-unlocked-plans-t-mobile/\">the iPhone 5 now will support the 1700 MHz HSPA+/AWS uplink band</a>, which will enable higher performance on T-Mobile's UMTS Band IV network. Older GSM iPhone 5 units cannot get this fix via software; it's a chip change.</p><p>
	While this means that iPhone 5 and 4S handsets unlocked and moved from AT&amp;T to T-Mobile can never get the highest performance on the UMTS bands, there's hope; the iPhone 5 LTE support for AWS will work just fine on T-Mobile. Now there's just the little question of building out that LTE network (see below).</p><p>
	In contrast to the other three US cellphone carriers, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/04/technology/personaltech/t-mobile-breaks-free-of-cellphone-contracts-and-penalties.html?src=me&amp;ref=general&amp;_r=1&amp;\">T-Mobile has moved to overhaul</a> the most-despised feature of a phone plan: the contract. New subscribers have the option of buying the iPhone outright (starting at US$579 for a 16 GB model) or <a href=\"http://www.t-mobile.com/shop/phones/\">a $99 / $199 / $299 immediate charge</a>, just like the other carriers, followed by a payment plan of $20 a month for 24 months.</p><p>
	At the end of that payback window, however, that $20 comes right off the top of your bill -- the phone is yours, so you don't have to keep paying for it. (Try asking for that deal with Verizon.) Of course, if you do decide to leave T-Mobile with the iPhone before the two-year window is up, you still owe the remaining balance of the purchase cost -- but you don't pay a separate early termination fee (ETF).</p><p>
	Regarding 4G and LTE, T-Mobile's US network uses UMTS / HSPA+ \"3.5 G\" to achieve download speeds ranging up towards the 10 Mbit/sec threshold -- <a href=\"http://www.phonescoop.com/articles/article.php?a=376&amp;p=2707\">real-world performance</a> may vary. That doesn't really compete with the <a href=\"http://www.speedtest.net/wave/76af0b8b0274b40f\">observed</a> or <a href=\"http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9224364/AT_T_vs._Verizon_LTE_showdown_in_the_Big_Apple\">best-possible LTE performance</a> on Verizon, AT&amp;T or Sprint (yes, there are spots in NYC where you can get 40+ Mbit/sec download speeds).</p><p>
	If you're in the mood for crazy-fast LTE wireless on T-Mobile, you have to wait. <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2013/03/26/t-mobile-announces-first-lte-markets/\">T-Mobile's LTE buildout is covering only seven cities so far</a>, with more coming this summer and fall. Interestingly, the specs page for the iPhone 5 on T-Mobile's site only mentions GSM and UMTS (in the I and IV bands), with no discussion of LTE. That isn't a reflection of the actual hardware capabilities, but more likely a marketing consideration -- poor form to push LTE capability as a feature only available to a few customers.</p><p>

But Corona also has a following out there. It's <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2010/04/14/360idev-ansca-mobiles-corona-sdk/\">a Software Development Kit</a> (SDK) that has been updated quite a bit lately, and I did hear a few devs say it's what they use to make their titles. One game development student even told me he's being taught how to use Corona specifically at school, so the tool definitely has its fans.</p><p>
	Today, Corona has announced that it's hoping to make its platform more accessible than ever, with <a href=\"http://www.coronalabs.com/blog/2013/04/04/state-of-corona-new-public-release-free-re-imagining-pro/\">a new \"SDK Starter\" program</a> that will allow developers to make and sell apps with Corona for completely free. The SDK is available as a free download, and as long as you don't need certain features (like in-app purchases or analytics services), you can publish apps made with Corona for exactly zero dollars. Some other SDKs require you to use a certain splash screen on your app or advertise the service in some other way, but Corona's new program doesn't even require that -- it's really free.</p><p>
	Of course, the company does offer those other services, and more, <a href=\"http://www.coronalabs.com/store/\">with a Pro account</a>. Corona also says it's \"re-imagining\" what Pro will mean for the service, which essentially means a price raise, to US$599 a year on May 1. The current subscription is $349, and anyone can still get one at that price until the first of May. Pro users will have access to in-app purchases and various analytics, as well as the option to use Corona's high-end graphic features, and the plugin system.</p><p>
	But even if you're not interested in a full Pro subscription, it's nice to see that Corona's offering the free option for developers to try out the service for themselves. Unity, I would say, is still the leader in this area, and they <a href=\"https://store.unity3d.com/\">offer a free version of the tools</a> for developers to try. But you do need to pay to publish a commercial game on that platform, so maybe Corona will grab a few more users (and see a few more published titles) with this free opportunity.</p><p style=\"padding:5px;clear:both;\"><a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2013/04/04/corona-introduces-an-sdk-starter-will-raise-pro-price-to-599/\">Corona introduces an SDK starter, will raise Pro price to $599</a> originally appeared on <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com\">TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog</a> on Thu, 04 Apr 2013 22:00:00 EST.

	One of my favorite things about the App Store is that it can offer some completely original and crazy ideas. Developers do have to get approval from Apple to be published, but that approval doesn't require a game to make sense or be clear, only that it works as advertised. <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/badland/id535176909?mt=8\">Badland</a> is one such product of this system. It's a wild and wacky, totally alien experience that I don't think would get published anywhere else but on a platform such as the App Store.</p><p>
	It's a platformer of sorts. You guide a little creature with some weird, flappy arms through a 2D environment on an alien planet, touching the screen to send him flapping upwards and releasing it to let him float back down. I don't know what your creature's name is, or even what he is -- the game works without words, communicating the premise and the story entirely through gameplay. But as you move through the levels, avoiding dangers as best you can, you collect various objects that give you other abilities: You can split the little guy into a few different creatures, grow or shrink him, or speed him up or slow him down.</p><p>
	That's just in the first levels. Badland is simply oozing with creativity, both in terms of the gameplay situations it throws at you, but also in that incredible art. The actual levels are essentially drawn in black 2D outlines, but the game's background is a colorful, crazy planet, full of life that seems completely alien. The game's audio is very impressive as well -- you can clearly hear each clank and thump as your creature bounces his way through the world, and the ambient sound is also very well done.</p><p><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/badland/id535176909?mt=8\">Badland</a> is a treat, and we're lucky to have it. It's available for US$3.99, and as far as I'm concerned, it's a must-play game. Developers might argue about how \"open\" Apple's platform is, but being able to see such an original game like this on iOS makes me believe that Apple's doing something right.</p><p style=\"padding:5px;clear:both;\"><a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2013/04/04/daily-iphone-app-badland-is-a-gorgeous-alien-journey/\">Daily iPhone App: Badland is a gorgeous alien journey</a> originally appeared on <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com\">TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog</a> on Thu, 04 Apr 2013 20:00:00 EST.

	If you've been listening to the rumor mill lately, you might mistakenly assume that iPhone sales are plummeting. Indeed, a head-scratching and yet oft-repeated argument making the rounds these days suggests that Apple needs to behave more like Samsung if it wants to remain competitive in the smartphone market.</p><p>
	The cold hard data, however, paints a much different picture.</p><p>
	Recent data released by comScore shows that Apple's share of the smartphone market is growing while Samsung's is down ever so slightly.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\" \" src=\"http://www.blogcdn.com/www.tuaw.com/media/2013/04/iphone-feb-marketshare-1365107028.png\" style=\"width: 465px; height: 257px;\" /></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12pt;\">From December through February, Apple's average share of the smartphone market went up from 35% to 38.9%. Samsung's share, meanwhile, went up only slightly, from 20.3% to 21.3%. </span></p><p>
	comScore's results also reveal that every other handset maker experienced a decline in marketshare over the past few months. It goes without saying that the smartphone market is currently a two horse race between Apple and Samsung. But again, the data indicates that Apple's share of the smartphone market is growing faster than Samsung's.</p><p>
	The story is even rosier for Apple when we look at overall platform marketshare. <span style=\"font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12pt;\">Here we see that Apple's share during the three month period tracked by comScore went up by 3.9% to finish at 38.9%. And while Google's Android platform still reigns supreme with a 51.7% share, it's total marketshare actually decreased by 2 percentage points.</span></p><p>
	And lest you think this is a one time occurrence, previous data released by comScore suggests a more entrenched pattern. To wit, Google's share of smartphone subscribers for the three month period ending in January of 2013 was 52.3% while Apple's was 37.8%.</p><p>

	iPad kiosk enclosure design house <a href=\"http://nclosures.com\">nClosures</a> has come up with a fascinating and beautiful way to attach multiple iPads in artistic kiosk arrays. One of the firm's designers, William Coburn, came up with the idea that the company could build arrays of iPads that would \"mimic the form of what is being studied, developed or even conceptualized.\" From some initial ideas, <a href=\"http://www.nclosures.com/multiple-ipad-kiosk-array/\">nClosures created a modular and scalable Display Array</a> that can be configured in a number of ways to \"visually emulate specific ideas or phenomena being presented.\"</p><p>
	As an example, the company used the design to come up with a kiosk display that looks like the DNA double helix that could be used with DNA-related content or apps on the iPads. Another example (seen below) shows the modular array set up like a tree of iPads, something that could be used in a museum or public display focusing on trees.</p><p>
	nClosures invites those who are interested in creating a custom display using the Display Array to contact them for more information.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Design studio creates modular multiple iPad kiosk arrays Functional art\" data-src-height=\"316\" data-src-width=\"400\" src=\"http://www.blogcdn.com/www.tuaw.com/media/2013/04/treeipad0404.jpg\" style=\"margin:4px\" /></p><p style=\"padding:5px;clear:both;\"><a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2013/04/04/design-studio-creates-modular-multiple-ipad-kiosk-arrays-functi/\">Design studio creates modular multiple iPad kiosk arrays: Functional art</a> originally appeared on <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com\">TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog</a> on Thu, 04 Apr 2013 19:00:00 EST.

	To call <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kay\">Alan Kay</a> brilliant is an understatement.</p><p>
	Kay, in case you're unfamiliar with his work, is a Turing Award winner who played an integral role in the development of object-oriented programming. A highly respected computer scientist, Kay worked for many years at Xerox's famed Palo Alto Research Center and also did a stint as an Apple fellow in the company's Advanced Technology Group during the '80s and '90s.</p><p>
	The full extent of Kay's visionary prowess can be found in a <a href=\"http://www.mprove.de/diplom/gui/kay72.html\">1972 research paper</a> he wrote titled, \"A Personal Computer for Children of All Ages.\"</p><p>
	The research paper describes a device Kay dubbed the Dynabook, a notebook sized device with functionality remarkably similar to what the iPad would eventually go on to become.</p><p>
	To that end, Kay's vision for the Dynabook can in many ways be viewed as the not-so-ancient blueprint for modern day tablet computing. The device envisioned by Kay back in 1972 featured a display capable of displaying text and graphics, along with the ability to play several hours of audio files.</p><p>
	Kay also envisioned, back in 1972 mind you, that the Dynabook would be able to connect to high bandwidth networks, download remote content and even offer a virtual keyboard if need be.</p><blockquote><p>
		Suppose the display panel covers the full extent of the notebook surface. Any keyboard arrangement one might wish can then be displayed anywhere on the surface.</p></blockquote><p>
	Steve Jobs made that same exact point when he unveiled the original iPhone back in 2007.</p><p>
	[Pictured below: an illustration from Kay's research paper depicting kids playing with Dynabooks]</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Alan Kay has some choice criticisms about the iPad\" data-src-height=\"317\" data-src-width=\"465\" src=\"http://www.blogcdn.com/www.tuaw.com/media/2013/04/kids-with-dynabook.png\" style=\"margin:4px\" /></p><p>
	Kay was probably one of the few people whose opinion Jobs deeply valued, and some of Jobs' favorite quotes are attributable to Kay.</p><p>
	\"People who are really serious about software should make their own hardware\" and \"The best way to predict the future is to invent it\" are two that come to mind.</p><p>
	All that said, one would imagine that Kay would be particularly thrilled with Apple's iPad, a device that eerily embodies many of his predictions almost 40 years later. <a href=\"http://techland.time.com/2013/04/02/an-interview-with-computing-pioneer-alan-kay/\">In a recent interview</a> with Time Magazine's David Greelish, Kay levied a few harsh criticisms on Apple's wildly popular tablet.</p><p>
	According to Kay, Apple's iPad not only fails to live up to the promise outlined in his ridiculously ahead-of-his-time research paper, but betrays it to a certain extent.</p><blockquote><p>
		For all media, the original intent was \"symmetric authoring and consuming.\" Isn't it crystal-clear that this last and most important service is quite lacking in today's computing for the general public? Apple with the iPad and iPhone goes even further and does not allow children to download an Etoy made by another child somewhere in the world. This could not be farther from the original intentions of the entire ARPA-IPTO/PARC community in the '60s and '70s. Apple's reasons for this are mostly bogus, and to the extent that security is an issue, what is insecure are the OSes supplied by the vendors (and the insecurities are the result of their own bad practices -- they are not necessary).</p></blockquote><p>
	I'm not quite sure where Kay is coming from here. For instance, there are no shortage of stories of individuals who are sometimes <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2011/11/12/2556021/sixth-grader-ios-games-app-club-TEDx\">as young as 12</a> (if not younger) who learn how to program and subsequently release an app on iTunes, instantly making their work accessible to millions of iOS users across the world. There are also apps like <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/minecraft-pocket-edition/id479516143?mt=8\">Minecraft</a>, <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2012/03/13/daily-ipad-app-woodcraft-helps-you-design-your-next-building-pr/\">Woodcraft</a> and <a href=\"http://edengame.net\">Eden</a> which allow sharing of created objects and worlds.</p><p>
	Kay also took issue with the iPad's user interface, calling it \"very poor in a myriad of ways.\"</p><p>
	With Scott Forstall now out of the Apple mix, perhaps that leaves the door open for Kay to return to Apple and really spice things up.</p><p>
	All kidding aside, Kay's entire interview with Time is worth a thorough read. Kay is incredibly sharp and insightful, and while he has a few bones to pick with the iPad, he shares a number of interesting perspectives on computing, education and business leadership. He also talks about what it was like to work at Xerox, Apple, HP and Disney.</p><p style=\"padding:5px;clear:both;\"><a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2013/04/04/alan-kay-has-some-choice-criticisms-about-the-ipad/\">Alan Kay has some choice criticisms about the iPad</a> originally appeared on <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com\">TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog</a> on Thu, 04 Apr 2013 18:30:00 EST.

	Apple has <a href=\"http://www.patentlyapple.com/patently-apple/2013/04/apple-reveals-a-virtual-home-button-and-a-cool-new-way-to-access-your-apps-without-having-to-unlock-your-idevice.html\">filed a patent</a> for something I would love to see implemented in a future iOS update: Quick access to certain apps directly from the iPhone's lockscreen. Patently Apple says that the patent application outlines a system of rotating the \"slide to unlock\" slider on iOS' lockscreen upwards, and then providing access to a number of apps directly, without having to unlock the phone and find the apps on the home screen.</p><p>
	I could not love this idea more. I think one of iOS' biggest weaknesses is the home screen's lack of actual functionality. Apple has taken half measures by providing direct access to the camera app and a better implementation of the Notification Center, but most of the lockscreen is wasted space. There's almost no way to add information and functionality you want. It's a major loss, especially when you consider how Apple's competitors have handled things. Obviously Apple wants a good-looking way to do it, and I respect that. But this idea definitely seems like it offers some good possibilities.</p><p>
	According to Apple's patent, the sliding display would feature a touch-sensitive home button, and the way you'd get access to these apps would be to enter some specific combination of gestures on that button directly. Of course, like all of the patents we see come out of Apple, there's no guarantee that this will ever be implemented in this way. But man, I'd definitely like to see more functionality on my iPhone's lockscreen, however it's put together.</p><p style=\"padding:5px;clear:both;\"><a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2013/04/04/apple-files-patent-for-app-access-on-lockscreen/\">Apple files patent for app access on lockscreen</a> originally appeared on <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com\">TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog</a> on Thu, 04 Apr 2013 18:00:00 EST.

To promote their new service the company has published a stunningly <a href=\"http://rememberum.com/steve-jobs-tribute/\">creative tribute </a>to Apple founder Steve Jobs, designed to look like the original Mac OS.<br /><br />
	On <a href=\"http://www.davidkelley.me/2013/03/steve-jobs-microsite/\">his blog</a> Rememberum developer David Kelly described the process of creating the unique design of the tribute site.</p><blockquote>
	One of the primary goals of the design was to simulate the original Macintosh OS interface as closely as possible - this meant pixelated (pixel-perfect) graphics as well as some of the original functionality of the Macintosh, such as keyboard folder navigation and double-clicking. We separated key points in his life into groups of folders and individual files. The folders have keyboard navigation and it is possible to hold down CTRL to select multiple files to open. Each file opens as a 'textpad' file and can be moved and cascaded like any window. This, coupled with the keyboard navigation and small retro animations helped to provide a more genuine experience of the original Macintosh computer.</blockquote>
Rememberum's service is free to use, though the FAQ on the site mentions a future premium option. Details are still scant on the premium option and if it will allow users to create tributes like the Steve Jobs memorial for their own loved ones.<p style=\"padding:5px;clear:both;\"><a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2013/04/04/online-steve-jobs-memorial-pays-tribute-to-the-original-mac-os/\">Online Steve Jobs memorial pays tribute to the original Mac OS</a> originally appeared on <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com\">TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog</a> on Thu, 04 Apr 2013 17:30:00 EST.

	Today saw a number of big releases on the App Store worth trying out. Here's a quick roundup of some of the biggest new app releases.</p><ul><li>
		Disney has released a game called <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mittens/id597701101?mt=8\">Mittens</a>, which looks impressive. It was put together by a company called Metrogames, so it's not a fully internal product. But most of Disney's work lately has been putting their own brands on titles like Temple Run, so it's good to see something with an original spin.

	Are you about to purchase an iPad? There's good news if you are -- Apple 2.0 is reporting that <a href=\"http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2013/04/04/apple-ipad-price-cuts/\">three large retailers have lowered prices on the iPad and iPad mini</a>. <a href=\"http://bestbuy.com\">Best Buy</a>, <a href=\"http://walmart.com\">Walmart</a> and <a href=\"http://macmall.com\">MacMall</a> are all showing price cuts on the third-generation iPad and the iPad mini, possibly signaling that the retailers are beginning to clear inventory for new models of Apple's popular tablet.</p><p>
	There are definitely some bargains to be found on the full-sized iPad. A 64 GB WiFi + Cellular third-generation iPad was selling for US$779.99 at Best Buy and is now showing a sale price of $545.99. A 64 GB Wi-Fi model was going for $649.99 and is now a bargain at $454.99. Remember, the third-generation iPad includes a Retina display...</p><p>
	While Best Buy retained regular pricing on the iPad mini, Walmart has done a price rollback on the 16 GB Wi-Fi model, knocking the price back to $299. MacMall has dropped the price on a large variety of iPad mini models, with cuts from $10 to $29 depending on the storage capacity and connectivity.</p><p style=\"padding:5px;clear:both;\"><a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2013/04/04/big-box-online-retailers-slash-ipad-prices/\">Big box, online retailers slash iPad prices</a> originally appeared on <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com\">TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog</a> on Thu, 04 Apr 2013 16:00:00 EST.

	If you are like me, you do a lot of searching every day. Not just Google, but IMDb for movie info, Amazon, TED talks and even TUAW. To help out people like you and me, <a href=\"http://www.cynapse.com/phlo\">Cynapse Software</a> has introduced a nifty utility called <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/phlo/id547094813?mt=12\">Phlo</a>. It provides a pop-up search field that be assigned to a global hotkey and always ready to go.</p><p>
	If you're looking to go beyond Google, there are dozens of combinations, and you can have multiple search engines selected. There's an extensive list of search portals buillt in, but you can add your own by simply providing a URL.</p><p>
	In the open Phlo window, you can start to type the name of a search engine and it will pop up for one-time access. You never have to use your mouse, and multiple sites can be chosen with shift + return or shift + click if you want to use your mouse. Out of the box, Phlo is configured to pop up with option + spacebar, but you can define any key or combination. Apple Spotlight uses Command + Spacebar. The ESC key closes Phlo.</p><p>
	After you've used Phlo for awhile, it becomes second nature. I found it to be a timesaver, because your searches begin with just a tap on the keyboard, and I find myself doing more searches because it is so easy to get them started. The only change I would make in this app is an ability to create groups of search engines for specific tasks, and have Phlo remember those groups.</p><p><div class=\"postgallery\"><p><strong>Gallery: <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/photos/phlo/\">Phlo</a></strong></p><a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/photos/phlo/#5790617\"><img src=\"http://www.blogcdn.com/www.tuaw.com/media/2013/04/phlo3_thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\" \" /></a><a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/photos/phlo/#5790618\"><img src=\"http://www.blogcdn.com/www.tuaw.com/media/2013/04/phlo2_thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\" \" /></a><a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/photos/phlo/#5790619\"><img src=\"http://www.blogcdn.com/www.tuaw.com/media/2013/04/phlo1_thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\" \" /></a></div></p><p>
	Phlo is US$3.99 at the Apple app store, and requires OS X 10.8 or later and a 64-bit processor. I like Phlo, and have incorporated it into my daily routine.</p><p></p><p style=\"padding:5px;clear:both;\"><a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2013/04/04/phlo-for-mac-is-a-quick-and-useful-search-utility/\">Phlo for Mac is a quick and useful search utility</a> originally appeared on <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com\">TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog</a> on Thu, 04 Apr 2013 15:00:00 EST.

	The Financial Times is reporting that Apple has pulled the \"<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id604682855?mt=8\">jingdian shucheng</a>\" app from the Chinese App Store since the app provided access to three books by banned author Wang Lixiong.

	In June of 2011, Steve Jobs <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2011/06/08/steve-jobs-unveils-new-apple-campus-that-literally-looks-like-a/\">stood before the Cupertino City Council</a> and announced Apple's desire to build a massive new campus on 98 acres of land it had previously acquired from Hewlett Packard.</p><p>
	And by massive, I mean that it will have a <a href=\"http://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/calculating_the_size_of_apples_spaceship_hq/\">slightly larger footprint</a> than the Pentagon.</p><p>
	Jobs explained that Apple was undergoing a period of tremendous growth and that it was renting buildings adjacent to its 1 Infinite Loop campus in order to house its ever-growing number of employees.</p><p>
	\"We've rented every scrap of building we could find in Cupertino,\" Jobs previously noted.</p><p>
	Apple's proposed new campus will be able to accommodate 12,000 employees, will feature an auditorium large enough to host WWDC-scale presentations and will sport a cafeteria capable of seating 3,000.</p><p>
	As you can tell from the architectural renderings pictured above, the design of the new campus will be anchored by a large circular building.</p><p>
	\"It's a little like a spaceship landed,\" Jobs explained to the council. \"It's got this gorgeous courtyard in the middle, but it's got a lot more.\"</p><p>
	In typical Apple style, Jobs boasted that the planned structure would be comprised of curved glass.</p><p>
	\"There's not a single straight piece of glass in this building,\" Jobs said at the time. \"We've used our experience in building retail buildings all over the world. We know how to make the biggest pieces of glass for architectural use. And, we want to make the glass specifically for this building here. We can make it curve all the way around the building... It's pretty cool.\"</p><p>
	While Jobs initially hoped that the campus would be completed by 2015, things haven't exactly gone as planned. Apple hasn't even broken ground yet and the new campus likely won't be finished until 2016 at the earliest.</p><p>
	What's more, BusinessWeek <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-04-04/apples-campus-2-shapes-up-as-an-investor-relations-nightmare#p1\">is reporting that Apple's initial US$3 billion budget</a> for the project has shot up to $5 billion.</p><blockquote><p>
		Since 2011, the budget for Apple's Campus 2 has ballooned from less than $3 billion to nearly $5 billion, according to five people close to the project who were not authorized to speak on the record. If their consensus estimate is accurate, Apple's expansion would eclipse the $3.9 billion being spent on the new World Trade Center complex in New York, and the new office space would run more than $1,500 per square foot -- three times the cost of many top-of-the-line downtown corporate towers.</p></blockquote><p>
	The report relays that one of the reasons for the delay is that Apple is still working with its lead architectural firm -- Foster + Partners -- to lower the budget by as much as $1 billion. Part of the cost overrun is due to Jobs' extremely particular taste with respect to materials.</p><blockquote><p>
		As with Apple's products, Jobs wanted no seam, gap or paintbrush stroke showing; every wall, floor and even ceiling is to be polished to a supernatural smoothness. All of the interior wood was to be harvested from a specific species of maple, and only the finer-quality \"heartwood\" at the center of the trees would be used, says one person briefed on the plan last year.</p></blockquote><p>
	As it stands now, Apple will reportedly begin removing the 26 buildings which currently occupy the eventual landing spot for the \"spaceship\" this June.</p><p>
	As a point of interest, Apple is doing all it can to make its new campus as green as possible. To that end, campus parking will be underground as to maintain the above-ground foliage while the roof will be comprised of 700,000 square feet of solar panels.</p><p style=\"padding:5px;clear:both;\"><a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2013/04/04/apples-planned-spaceship-campus-reportedly-2-billion-over-bu/\">Apple's planned 'spaceship' campus reportedly $2 billion over budget</a> originally appeared on <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com\">TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog</a> on Thu, 04 Apr 2013 13:00:00 EST.

	Slowly, but surely, Thunderbolt docks are starting to appear from peripheral manufacturers. The <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2013/03/03/matrox-ds1-is-a-practical-powerful-thunderbolt-dock/\">Matrox DS1</a> has shipped to much acclaim, although Belkin's promised <a href=\"http://www.belkin.com/us/p/F4U055tt#\">Thunderbolt Express Dock</a> has slipped past the promised Q1 ship date. Now Sonnet has announced that the <a href=\"http://www.sonnettech.com/product/echo15thunderboltdock.html#\">Echo 15 Thunderbolt Dock</a> (starting at US$399.95) is available for pre-order.</p><p>
	The Echo 15 is good-sized, and for a very good reason: it's full of ports, adds a DVD or Blu-ray drive, supports an internal HD or SSD, and uses Mini DisplayPort to connect to a number of display interfaces.</p><p>
	Sonnet is starting with four configurations:</p><ul><li>
		Dock with DVD drive -- $399.95</li><li>
		Dock with Blu-ray drive -- $449.95</li><li>
		Dock with DVD drive and 2 TB HDD -- $499.95</li><li>
		Dock with Blu-ray drive and 2 TB HDD -- $549.95</li></ul><p>
	All of the configurations show a Summer 2013 ship date.

	The encryption used by Apple's iMessage service is hindering federal drug enforcement agency investigations, says <a href=\"http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-57577887-38/apples-imessage-encryption-trips-up-feds-surveillance/\">a report in CNET</a>. CNET obtained an internal Drug Enforcement Administration document that details the problem faced by agents who are tracking suspects using non-traditional communication methods.</p><p>
	According to the document, the end-to-end encryption used by iMessage makes it \"impossible to intercept iMessages between two Apple devices,\" even when there is a court order authorizing the electronic wiretap. This problem was discovered when agents noticed that messages sent from one iPhone to another iPhone via <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/tag/iMessage/\">iMessage</a> were not being captured during a surveillance.</p><p>
	The inability to adequately conduct surveillance is a growing problem for law enforcement. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mueller\">FBI director Robert Mueller</a> recently told Congress that \"there is a growing and dangerous gap between law enforcement's legal authority to conduct electronic surveillance, and its actual ability to conduct such surveillance.\" He asked Congress \"to ensure that the laws by which we operate and which provide protection to individual privacy rights keep pace with new threats and new technology.\"</p><p style=\"padding:5px;clear:both;\"><a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2013/04/04/apples-imessage-encryption-thwarts-government-investigations/\">Apple's iMessage encryption thwarts government investigations</a> originally appeared on <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com\">TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog</a> on Thu, 04 Apr 2013 11:30:00 EST.

	As noticed by <a href=\"http://appleinsider.com/articles/13/04/04/apple-adds-age-rating-tags-to-ios-app-store-descriptions\">AppleInsider</a>, Apple has started highlighting the age ratings of apps in the iOS App Store. The age rating of an app now appears directly underneath the name and developer of an app in the app preview screen. It'll be one of the first pieces of information that a user will see when they look at an app. Earlier the age rating was at the bottom of an app's listing on the iOS version of the App Store (seen below).</p><p><img alt=\"Apple adds age rating icon to iOS App Store descriptions\" data-src-height=\"90\" data-src-width=\"456\" src=\"http://www.blogcdn.com/www.tuaw.com/media/2013/04/ageratingiosold4343.jpg\" style=\"margin:4px\" /></p><p>
	Most iOS users won't care about the age rating of an app, but it is very helpful for parents. The age rating allows you <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2013/03/29/securing-your-ios-device-for-your-children-part-2-lock-down-yo/\">to use parental controls</a> to restrict apps that your child can access. If you don't use parental controls, it'll give you a quick glimpse at the targeted age for an app and let you decide if its appropriate for your child.</p><p style=\"padding:5px;clear:both;\"><a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2013/04/04/apple-adds-age-rating-icon-to-ios-app-store-descriptions/\">Apple adds age rating icon to iOS App Store descriptions</a> originally appeared on <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com\">TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog</a> on Thu, 04 Apr 2013 10:00:00 EST.

	Every year around tax time, millions of small-business owners promise themselves that next year will be different. They'll keep better records; they'll invoice customers on time; and they'll figure out a way of monitoring how well -- or poorly -- their company is doing. <a href=\"http://kashoo.com\">Kashoo</a> created an easy-to-use cloud accounting service and a <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kashoo-accounting/id442878143?mt=8\">free iPad app</a> to go along with it, and today a new version is arriving in the App Store to help those business owners keep their new tax year resolution.</p><p>
	One of the nicest improvements to <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2012/02/20/kashoo-ipad-app-business-accounting-on-the-go/\">Kashoo since we first reviewed it</a> is the ability to take a photo of a receipt with the built-in iPad camera, and then attach it to an expense within the app. Since the IRS requires physical receipts for expenses, this addition makes it much easier for business owners to capture the information to back up those expenses. Accounting professionals who are using Kashoo to help small-business clients will be able to have those clients submit receipts from the iPad app, and can then reconcile them through the web app.</p><p>
	As TV pitchmen love to say, \"But wait, there's more!\" Direct printing via AirPrint has been added, so documents no longer have to be emailed to a Mac or PC prior to printing. There's a new duplicate feature for speeding data entry, and a template selector makes choosing invoice styles fast and easy.</p><p>
	The short video below furnishes a good synopsis of the new Kashoo features. The app is free to download, but requires the purchase of a monthly (US$19.99) or annual ($189.99) subscription to use the service.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe allowtransparency=\"true\" class=\"wistia_embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"342\" name=\"wistia_embed\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/ru51au4q9z?controlsVisibleOnLoad=true&amp;plugin%5BpostRoll-v1%5D%5Blink%5D=http%3A%2F%2Fappstore.com%2Fkashooaccounting&amp;plugin%5BpostRoll-v1%5D%5Bstyle%5D%5BbackgroundColor%5D=%23fcfcfc&amp;plugin%5BpostRoll-v1%5D%5Bstyle%5D%5Bcolor%5D=%23184766&amp;plugin%5BpostRoll-v1%5D%5Bstyle%5D%5BfontFamily%5D=Gill%20Sans%2C%20Helvetica%2C%20Arial%2C%20sans-serif&amp;plugin%5BpostRoll-v1%5D%5Bstyle%5D%5BfontSize%5D=36px&amp;plugin%5BpostRoll-v1%5D%5Btext%5D=Download%20on%20the%20App%20Store&amp;version=v1&amp;videoHeight=434&amp;videoWidth=578&amp;volumeControl=true\" width=\"456\"></iframe></p><p style=\"padding:5px;clear:both;\"><a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2013/04/04/kashoo-version-2-1-adds-new-features-just-in-time-for-taxes/\">Kashoo Version 2.1 adds new features just in time for taxes</a> originally appeared on <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com\">TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog</a> on Thu, 04 Apr 2013 09:00:00 EST.

	Twitter updated <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/twitter/id333903271?mt=8\">its iOS app</a> to version 5.5 and added support for its <a href=\"https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards\">Twitter Cards</a> feature. Twitter Cards let developers and content creators attach media and links to Tweets. In the iOS app, it'll let users tap a link in a tweet and view content directly in an app that is installed on their iOS device. If an app is not installed, users can launch and install an app directly from a link within a tweet.</p><p>
	Besides Cards, the latest Twitter for iOS app also includes the following improvements and bug fixes:</p><ul><li>
		Faster launch times and general performance upgrades</li><li>
		\"Retweeted by\" in Tweet detail is now tappable</li><li>
		Fix for reply-to-self in conversations</li><li>

The photo sharing app was a personal favorite of Apple's Phil Schiller and was chosen as Apple's 2011 iPhone app of the year. Rather quickly, the app amassed millions of users and was held up by Apple enthusiasts as an example of why the iOS ecosystem was superior to Android's.</p><p>
	Instagram's iOS exclusivity, however, wasn't destined to last. After 17 months as an iOS-only application, the Instagram team finally released Instagram for Android on April 3, 2012.</p><p>
	One year later, close to half of Instagram's now 100 million+ users are on Android.</p><p>
	In a blog post <a href=\"http://blog.instagram.com/post/47035276788/instagram-for-android-one-year-later-one-year\">detailing the achievements</a> of Instagram for Android over the past 12 months, Instagram team member Philip McAllister wrote:</p><blockquote><p>
		One year ago today we launched Instagram for Android. In less than a day, over a million people downloaded the app, and now nearly half of all Instagrammers use the Android app to share photos with friends, family and the world.</p></blockquote><p>
	That's quite an impressive feat.</p><p>
	As for Schiller, you might remember that he deleted his Instagram account shortly after the app hit Android. For what it's worth, Schiller subsequently explained that his decision had nothing to do with Android per se, but was rather the result of Instagram getting a bit too big for his liking.</p><p>
	At the time, 9to5Mac was able to get in touch with Schiller who <a href=\"http://9to5mac.com/2012/04/19/apple-marketing-svp-phil-schiller-dumps-instagram-over-expansion-to-android/\">explained his decision</a>.</p><blockquote><p>
		Instagram is a great app and community. That hasn't changed.</p><p>
		But one of the things I really liked about Instagram was that it was a small community of early adopters sharing their photographs.</p><p>
		Now that it has grow(n) much larger the signal to noise ratio is different. That isn't necessarily good or bad, it's just not what I originally had fun with.</p></blockquote><p>
	Going forward, it'll be interesting to see if and when the number of active Instagram users on Android surpasses the number of Instagram users on iOS. For those keeping score at home, iOS amassed a 30 million user head start during the 17 months it was an iOS exclusive.</p><p style=\"padding:5px;clear:both;\"><a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2013/04/03/close-to-half-of-instagrams-100-million-users-are-on-android/\">Close to half of Instagram's 100 million+ users are on Android</a> originally appeared on <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com\">TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog</a> on Wed, 03 Apr 2013 22:30:00 EST.

	Ultima Forever is one of the weirdest brand experiments I've seen pop up on iOS so far. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultima_(series)\">Ultima is</a>, of course, one of the oldest and best-loved RPG series in video games, with over a dozen different variations and versions. And EA has decided to bring the Ultima series to iOS with Ultima Forever, which is sort of a remake or reimagining of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultima_IV:_Quest_of_the_Avatar\">Ultima IV</a>, one of the most popular versions of Ultima.<br /><br />
	\"Remake or reimagining\" is still sort of a simplification of exactly what this game is, and even after having seen and played it at GDC last week, it's still kind of tough to put down exactly how this game is related to Ultima IV and the rest of the series. There are some quests and storylines from the old game, and the graphics are related. But some of the quests are set years in the future, as if it's a sequel to the old title. And some of the gameplay ideas are taken directly from the old game (it's a fantasy action RPG that has to do with you as a character questing up to try and become the Avatar while honing your various values like Honesty and Honor), but others are very new: There are some freemium elements to this title, and it's an MMO, so you'll see other players questing around you as you play, and you'll be able to team up with friends while taking down dungeons.<br /><br />
	In other words, Ultima Forever is a weird one. It is fun -- the game offers up a lot of really interesting content, and while the combat is tight and fun, there's also some interesting questlines to follow, and stories to discover around the world that should appeal to both old and new Ultima players. There's a nice amount of complexity in the leveling as well, with new gear to discover and equip and plenty of reputations and attributes to grind out and grow more powerful in.<br /><br />
	At the same time, however, EA has integrated some freemium elements into the game, which can get annoying very quickly. As you play through the dungeon, you earn keys, which can then be used at various points to open chests and give you a random chance at some loot. The lowest quality keys can be easy to find, and they will award you some (relatively cheap) loot. But higher quality keys are rarer, and some will need to be purchased with real money, and then used to unlock ability slots or better gear.<br /><br />
	Even in the few minutes I had to play through the game at GDC, dealing with the keys was an annoying pain, and it's frustrating that EA here isn't willing to just let players play with the game directly, instead inserting this currency mechanic at every turn. It's still too early to pass judgment on the finished title, but the keys seem like a bad mark on an otherwise very impressive game. Older Ultima players, especially, might be really disappointed to see their old memories tarnished with constant, cheap attempts to sell in-app currency.<br /><br />
	Perhaps that's too harsh, though -- the game's not done yet, and it's going to go through a thorough beta period before it finally arrives worldwide later on this summer. Hopefully, EA will tune it right, so that those who fondly remember Ultima can enjoy this celebration of it without being constantly pestered with freemium nonsense.</p><p style=\"padding:5px;clear:both;\"><a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2013/04/03/ultima-forever-looks-impressive-but-may-have-some-freemium-prob/\">Ultima Forever looks impressive, but may have some freemium problems</a> originally appeared on <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com\">TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog</a> on Wed, 03 Apr 2013 22:00:00 EST.

	Developer David Frampton is one of our favorites around here at TUAW -- he made a big splash on the App Store a while ago with <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2010/06/15/wwdc-2010-hands-on-with-chopper-2/\">Chopper 2</a>, but these days he's working on a huge sandbox app he's made called <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/the-blockheads/id519596406?mt=8\">The Blockheads</a>, which is a Minecraft-style game where you can explore a world with the titular characters, making and building items and contraptions from the items that you can find and collect.</p><p>
	The Blockheads is doing very well for Frampton -- he says the game has seen over four million downloads so far, and it's definitely the biggest project he's ever worked on. The game's gotten even bigger after a recent update that allowed \"backgrounding,\" too. When the game first arrived, you had to basically watch your Blockheads perform their tasks, and leaving the app caused the task to pause as well. <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2013/01/15/daily-iphone-app-the-blockheads-is-another-great-take-on-sandbo/\">I mentioned this in the game's inital review</a>, and while the game was still a lot of fun, longer tasks could be very annoying.</p><p>
	Frampton says he agrees that requiring the app to stay open while those tasks were running could be annoying, but during the game's initial development, he just wasn't sure if backgrounding could work, \"whether I could do that or not.\" The game's monetization depends on using time crystals to skip past tasks as well, and Frampton included the ability to bring in a few different characters at a time, which he hoped would help people with the waiting periods.</p><p>
	Unfortunately, he says, \"only 1% of players warped in a second Blockhead,\" which means that most of his players didn't use the tools he'd given them to make the waiting more bearable. That convinced him he had to find a solution, and the backgrounding patch went in recently (along with a price drop on actually bringing in a second character). Frampton says the change has helped him, both with exposure for the app as well as growing the audience. \"Everything doubled,\" he says about making the change.</p><p>
	As for what's next in Blockheads, Frampton has a huge list of features, both from things he wants to do as well as fan requests. There's a tutorial coming into the game, to smooth out the initial player experience, which he feels can still be a bit confusing. Fans on the message boards have asked him for the ability to create signs (because right now there's no way to see what's in the game's chests until you open them up), but Frampton isn't sure that's a good idea. He's more interested in providing \"shelves,\" which would be storage items where you can see exactly what's being stored at just a glance.</p><p>
	Currently, there is two-player local multiplayer, but Frampton says that Game Center is really causing problems with any larger multiplayer game, as the system is not very good at keeping game sessions running when one player leaves or enters. So multiplayer is up in the air for now, though Frampton says it's definitely a possibility at some point in the future.</p><p>
	In other future plans, he says he'd love to bring more complicated machinery to the game, like copper wiring, elevators, and even electricity. Fans have asked for more goals, so he'll be filling out the endgame as well. But unlike Minecraft, says Frampton, he doesn't want the game to \"end\" at all. \"I can keep adding more and more games to it,\" he told me. One idea he has is to allow players to build up technology to the point where they can travel to other worlds, which would obviously open up a whole new set of resources and areas to explore.</p><p>
	That's all in the distant future of the game, however -- Frampton is just brainstorming ideas, not simply working on actual features for that yet. Still, The Blockheads is definitely a popular title, and Frampton says he personally is excited by the process of creating and developing this game, in a way that he wasn't with Chopper 2 or his other titles. If you haven't gone to check out The Blockheads yet, you can <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/the-blockheads/id519596406?mt=8\">find it on the App Store</a> for free right now.</p><p style=\"padding:5px;clear:both;\"><a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2013/04/03/majic-jungles-the-blockheads-charges-on/\">Majic Jungle's The Blockheads charges on</a> originally appeared on <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com\">TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog</a> on Wed, 03 Apr 2013 21:30:00 EST.

	In April 2012, security researchers discovered a new piece of malware targeting OS X users. The <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2012/04/05/how-to-find-remove-the-flashback-trojan/\">malware was dubbed \"Flashback\"</a> and reportedly infected more than 600,000 Mac users, including about 200 machines on Apple's Cupertino campus. The malware was able to infect so many machines because it was cleverly masqueraded as a fake Adobe Flash installer.</p><p>
	Once active, the malware would inject ads from pay-per-click providers into search results instead of sourcing the ads from Google. The security firm Symantec estimated that the malware had the potential to net its creators upwards of US$10,000 a day, but further analysis<span style=\"font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12pt;\"></span><a href=\"http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/osxflashback-how-turn-your-botnet\" style=\"font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12pt;\">indicated that the actual payout</a><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12pt;\"> was much lower.</span></p><blockquote><p>
		From our analysis we have seen that, for a three-week period starting in April, the botnet displayed over 10 million ads on compromised computers but only a small percentage of users who were shown ads actually clicked them, with close to 400,000 ads being clicked. These numbers earned the attackers $14,000 in these three weeks, although it is worth mentioning that earning the money is only one part of the puzzle -- actually collecting that money is another, often more difficult, job. Many PPC providers employ anti-fraud measures and affiliate-verification processes before paying.</p></blockquote><p>
	About a week after the malware was first publicized, Apple issued a software update to remove the malware from affected machines.</p><p>
	Over the past few months, investigative reporter and former Washington Post journalist Brian Krebs <a href=\"http://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/04/who-wrote-the-flashback-os-x-worm/\">did a bit of sleuthing</a> and was able to piece together a number of clues which purport to reveal the identity of the man behind the Flashback malware.</p><p>
	By lurking on forum threads on a Russian-language site dedicated to black-hat SEO, the art of deceptively manipulating search results for monetary gain, Krebs was eventually able to acquire some revealing information.</p><p>
	In a private message obtained by Krebs, he found that one user with the handle \"mavook\" was looking to get an invitation to Darkod, a cybercrime forum. In order to prove his bonafides, mavook took responsibility for the Flashback botnet while boasting that he specializes \"in finding exploits and creating bots.\"</p><p>
	Krebs adds:</p><blockquote><p>
		The senior member that Mavook petitions is quite well-known in the Russian cybercrime underground, and these two individuals also are well-known to one another. In fact, in a separate exchange on the main BlackSEO forum between the senior member and a BlackSEO user named JPS, the senior member recommends Mavook as a guy who knows his stuff and can be counted on to produce reliable attack tools.</p></blockquote><p>
	Following that, Krebs took a look at mavook's profile page and saw that his personal homepage was at one point mavook.com. Krebs was then able to look at old WHOIS registration records and come up with a name -- Maxim Selikhanovich, a 30-year-old from Saransk, Russia.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12pt;\">The full details behind Krebs' investigation are rather interesting and worth checking out in their entirety.</span></p><p style=\"padding:5px;clear:both;\"><a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2013/04/03/security-researcher-brian-krebs-outs-the-man-behind-the-flashbac/\">Security Researcher Brian Krebs outs the man behind the Flashback malware</a> originally appeared on <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com\">TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog</a> on Wed, 03 Apr 2013 21:00:00 EST.

	Injustice: Gods Among Us is a game that's been coming to consoles for a while now -- it's a fighting game, made by the same team behind Mortal Kombat, that features DC Universe superheroes battling it out against each other. The team has <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/injustice-gods-among-us/id575658129?mt=8\">released an iOS version of the game</a>, and while it's not exactly the same as the console titles, as you can see above, it looks pretty darn good anyway. This version is being made by the same division of NetherRealm that made <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2011/12/22/daily-iphone-app-batman-arkham-city-lockdown/\">Batman: Arkham City Lockdown</a> for Apple's devices, and just like that \"port,\" this game goes above and beyond the call of just creating a mobile-sized version of its console brothers.</p><p style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;\">
	For one thing, the iOS version of Injustice will have three-on-three battles. You can see the interface for choosing a team and fighting <a href=\"http://www.ign.com/videos/2013/04/03/injustice-gods-among-us-ios-overview\">in this IGN video</a> -- you'll pick three heroes to fight with, and then attack back and forth by swiping various gestures across the screen. The graphics aren't exactly as cool as the console versions, but it looks like some of the same models are in use, and each hero comes with three levels of super moves, and can even be leveled up for higher hitpoints and damage.</p><p style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;\">
	The port looks very impressive indeed. I don't know if it'll be quite as good as the console game is looking, but it's clear NetherRealm isn't skimping on the quality when making an iOS version, and that's great to see. If you want to check the game out, you can <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/injustice-gods-among-us/id575658129?mt=8\">download it for free right now</a>.</p><p style=\"padding:5px;clear:both;\"><a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2013/04/03/injustice-gods-among-us-gets-an-original-ios-version/\">Injustice: Gods Among Us gets an original iOS version</a> originally appeared on <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com\">TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog</a> on Wed, 03 Apr 2013 20:30:00 EST.

	Online music-streaming service <a href=\"https://rdio.com\">Rdio</a> has announced the launch of <a href=\"http://vdio.com\">Vdio</a>, a new video-streaming service. Vdio is a pay-per-view service, unlike its sister program's \"all you can eat\" subscription model. The service builds off Rdio's social focus with Sets, playlists for TV shows and movies that make it easy to share and discover new content to watch. Furthering the social theme of the service is the ability to check out what your friends are watching at a given moment and jump into the program with them.</p><p>
	A service is only as strong as its content, but Vdio features most of the latest releases from the big screen to network television. Current titles range from movies such as <em>Zero Dark Thirty</em> to <em>The Hobbit</em> and <em>Skyfall</em>, while popular television programs such as <em>Breaking Bad</em>, <em>Homeland</em> and <em>Downton Abbey</em> make up the broadcast front. TV shows are available to stream the day after they air, and subscribing to a whole season provides a discounted price. The service doesn't have a deal worked out with HBO, meaning you'll have to look elsewhere to catch up on <em>Game of Thrones</em>.</p><p>
	At the moment the service is only available to Rdio Unlimited subscribers in the US and UK. Current subscribers, or anyone who subscribes in the next 60 days, will receive a US$25 credit towards the service to try it out.</p><p>
	Vdio is currently only available on the iPad or online. Other devices and platforms will be added in the future. Curiously, the iPad app does not allow users to rent or download content, but rather only allows for streaming things that have already been purchased.</p><p style=\"padding:5px;clear:both;\"><a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2013/04/03/rdio-introduces-social-video-streaming-service-vdio/\">Rdio introduces social video streaming service Vdio</a> originally appeared on <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com\">TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog</a> on Wed, 03 Apr 2013 20:00:00 EST.

Quite a few games have used the old 8-bit, top-down RPGs as a rubric, but bit Dungeon is probably the best example I've seen of all of them. You simply go from room to room, Legend of Zelda-style, hacking away at enemies, getting better gear and surviving as long as you can.</p><p>
	The controls are interesting -- rather than using virtual controls, you simply tap on the screen to move around, and then again to attack. This ends up working kind of like Diablo, actually, where you tap to move out of the way of certain incoming spells or monsters, and then tap back in for your own offense when the way is clear. The scheme works very well, and it allows you quite a bit of precision when you need it.</p><p>
	The game can be very harsh, in that when you die, that's essentially the end of that character. But I found health potions to be readily available, and as long as you make some smart choices while leveling up (and make sure you dodge as much as you can while in combat), the game is actually very rewarding and enjoyable. The great music and graphics help a lot as well. bit Dungeon is a really terrific title that's been a bit overlooked on the App Store.

	The important thing about e-books is this: the reader matters a lot less than the content. Over time, I've found myself using iBooks less and less and less, as I now turn almost exclusively to Kindle for my iPad reading.</p><p>
	There are several reasons for this. First, I can read my Kindle content on nearly any platform you can think of. Second, Kindle books are cheap. The same tech e-book that costs $36 on iTunes may show up up for $16.20 on Amazon.</p><p>
	Amazon is deeply invested in the \"reader thing\". Last week, <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/28/4157982/amazon-to-acquire-book-recommendation-social-network-goodreads\">they acquired Goodreads</a>, a popular site for sharing reviews and recommendations. The <a href=\"http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=97664&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1801561&amp;highlight=\">press release</a> quoted Amazon VP Russ Grandinetti, who said</p><blockquote><p>
		\"Amazon and Goodreads share a passion for reinventing reading. Goodreads has helped change how we discover and discuss books and, with Kindle, Amazon has helped expand reading around the world. In addition, both Amazon and Goodreads have helped thousands of authors reach a wider audience and make a better living at their craft. Together we intend to build many new ways to delight readers and authors alike.\"</p></blockquote><p>
	You can anticipate that Amazon will start incorporating Goodread's net of recommendations into their reader hardware and software sometime in the near future.</p><p>
	In the absence of an OS X iBook reading tool, some developers are tentatively testing out the waters. Latest to the scene is developer NeoMobili, whose <a href=\"http://www.neomobili.com/products/bookinist/\">Bookinist website</a> just recently went live. I've signed up to get notified when they launch, and hopefully I'll soon get a chance to test out the promised public beta.</p><p>
	Obviously, third parties will not be able to provide reading capabilities for DRM'ed e-books, providing another strike against buying them from the iBookstore instead of Kindle.</p><p>
	No one is ever going to argue that Amazon has set new standards of excellence for their software. My OS X Kindle app is functional at best, ugly at worst. But in the end, it's the book that you're reading that creates the end-user experience, not how prettily the pages turn.</p><p style=\"padding:5px;clear:both;\"><a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2013/04/03/ibook-lessons-why-the-kindle-app-is-still-the-best-reader-on-io/\">iBook Lessons: Why the Kindle App is still the best reader on iOS</a> originally appeared on <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com\">TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog</a> on Wed, 03 Apr 2013 19:05:00 EST.

Since the App Store opened its virtual doors, we've seen a lot of \"micro\" versions of larger genres, including platformers and RPGs.

Spring is here in the US. My <a href=\"http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/index.jsp?c_id=chc\">Cubs</a> are losing, and that must mean it's finally time for baseball season! <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2013/02/22/mlb-com-at-bat-ready-to-play-ball-for-2013-season/\">MLB's official At Bat app</a> is already out in the App Store if you want to listen to the real thing, but if you would rather have your pitching and hitting simulated, Out of the Park Baseball has you covered. The <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/iootp-baseball-2013/id597133395?mt=8\">revered baseball sim's iOS version</a> has already been updated with the 2013 roster, and <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ootp-baseball-13/id504501297?mt=12\">the Mac version</a> is set to get updated on April 15.</p><p>
Out of the Park Baseball is a great game for baseball fans, but of course it's all about the managing and simulation. If you want to actually play the game directly, it's probably not what you're looking for. For that, you'll have to wait.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12pt;\">There are </span><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/9-innings-2013-pro-baseball/id530061728?mt=8\" style=\"font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12pt;\">a few baseball games</a><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12pt;\"> out on the App Store, but they're either not full action baseball games or they're not yet updated with the 2013 rosters.

	Spring is here in the US. My <a href=\"http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/index.jsp?c_id=chc\">Cubs</a> are losing, and that must mean it's finally time for baseball season! <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2013/02/22/mlb-com-at-bat-ready-to-play-ball-for-2013-season/\">MLB's official At Bat app</a> is already out in the App Store if you want to listen to the real thing, but if you would rather have your pitching and hitting simulated, Out of the Park Baseball has you covered. The <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/iootp-baseball-2013/id597133395?mt=8\">revered baseball sim's iOS version</a> has already been updated with the 2013 roster, and <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ootp-baseball-13/id504501297?mt=12\">the Mac version</a> is set to get updated on April 15.</p><p>
	Out of the Park Baseball is a great game for baseball fans, but of course it's all about the managing and simulation. If you want to actually play the game directly, it's probably not what you're looking for. For that, you'll have to wait.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12pt;\">There are </span><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/9-innings-2013-pro-baseball/id530061728?mt=8\" style=\"font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12pt;\">a few baseball games</a><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12pt;\"> out on the App Store, but they're either not full action baseball games or they're not yet updated with the 2013 rosters.

Samsung and Google's Motorola Mobility have just scored a win over a famous Apple user interface patent.

Mueller also points out a fundamental difference between patent law in the US and patent law in Europe. Put simply, the patent requirements in Europe are more stringent to the extent that they are granted for technical solutions to technical problems.</p><p>
\"In this case,\" Mueller writes, \"the mere fact that a sliding gesture has a visual representation was not deemed to constitute a technical innovation worthy of patent protection.\"</p><p>
The death blow for Apple's slide to unlock patent was likely a Swedish phone called the Neonode N1m that launched well before the iPhone and featured its own slide to unlock implementation. The N1m was released in 2005 while Apple's own patent for slide to unlock wasn't filed until December of 2005.</p><p><iframe allowfullscreen=\" \" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/Tj-KS2kfIr0?rel=0\" width=\"420\"></iframe></p><p>
Skip ahead to about 3:58 into the video and you'll see something very familiar.</p><p>
Incidentally, a Dutch Court also found Apple's slide to unlock patent invalid because of the Neonode N1m.</p><p>
When Steve Jobs first introduced the iPhone, he confidently went over some of its unique features and boldly exclaimed, \"and boy have we patented it!\" Yet here Apple is, still battling over iPhone patents.</p><p style=\"padding:5px;clear:both;\"><a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2013/04/05/german-court-finds-apples-slide-to-unlock-patent-invalid/\">German Court finds Apple's 'slide to unlock' patent invalid</a> originally appeared on <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com\">TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog</a> on Fri, 05 Apr 2013 11:30:00 EST.

	\"In this case,\" Mueller writes, \"the mere fact that a sliding gesture has a visual representation was not deemed to constitute a technical innovation worthy of patent protection.\"</p><p>
	The death blow for Apple's slide to unlock patent was likely a Swedish phone called the Neonode N1m that launched well before the iPhone and featured its own slide to unlock implementation. The N1m was released in 2005 while Apple's own patent for slide to unlock wasn't filed until December of 2005.</p><p><iframe allowfullscreen=\" \" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/Tj-KS2kfIr0?rel=0\" width=\"420\"></iframe></p><p>
	Skip ahead to about 3:58 into the video and you'll see something very familiar.</p><p>
	Incidentally, a Dutch Court also found Apple's slide to unlock patent invalid because of the Neonode N1m.</p><p>
	When Steve Jobs first introduced the iPhone, he confidently went over some of its unique features and boldly exclaimed, \"and boy have we patented it!\" Yet here Apple is, still battling over iPhone patents.</p><p style=\"padding:5px;clear:both;\"><a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2013/04/05/german-court-finds-apples-slide-to-unlock-patent-invalid/\">German Court finds Apple's 'slide to unlock' patent invalid</a> originally appeared on <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com\">TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog</a> on Fri, 05 Apr 2013 11:30:00 EST.

Yesterday around the TUAW water cooler a number of us expressed our love of <a href=\"http://www.dueapp.com\">Due</a>, an app for Mac and iOS that is basically a simple timer/reminder application (my <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2011/03/03/due-a-simple-beautiful-wonderful-reminder-app-for-ios-devices/\">original review here</a>). After trying dozens of timer apps, I think Due wins for a number of features that make it stand out from a very crowded field. After all, your iDevice comes with a timer in the Clock app, and there's Apple's Reminders app. While Reminders syncs with iCloud, your alarms in the Clock app do not. Due can help you stay focused and never overcook a boiling egg again.</p><p>
Due's interface is simple as can be. There are three views: Reminders, Timers and Logged Reminders. You can quickly set a reminder for later in the day, or whenever. Due accepts natural language instructions, so you could say \"next Thursday at 1 PM\" and it'll set a reminder alarm for just that. Note that Due doesn't integrate with the built-in Reminders app, so I'm only referring to reminders (lower case) within Due itself.</p><p>
Once a reminder has gone off or you check it off manually, those go into Logged Reminders. This is handy if you need to recall what you did or if you need to remind yourself of the same thing again, later.</p><p>
I tend to use the timer function more frequently (as I use my calendar for appointments and OmniFocus for repeating tasks and \"to do\" items). I have a 25-minute timer for Pomodoros, a 5-minute timer for breaks and a couple of others for things I need to do at some point in the day, but things which require me to focus on just that thing for an allotted amount of time. By doing this, I help my squirrel-like brain stay focused on some critical tasks throughout the day, but it also helps me be flexible enough to not dread going out of being flexible in my daily schedule (more on this in next week's <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/tag/productivity/\">Productivity Tip</a>).</p><p>
Best of all, Due has just the right number of preferences. From changing sounds to setting a snooze time, Due can be as intrusive or quiet as you like. You can even change the alarms to use Notification Center or Growl -- handy especially if you use something like <a href=\"http://www.prowlapp.com\">Prowl</a>. I particularly like the option to \"suppress alerts on launch and wake\" because I hate opening my Mac to have 30 alarms from past events going off all at once. Is it just me or is that \"throw a million notifications at me on wake\" thing seem a very obtrusive, Windows 98-like behavior? But I digress.</p><p>
Due is a rock-solid, beautifully designed app. iCloud sync works flawlessly (you can also use Dropbox) across my Macs and iDevices, meaning I always have what I need where I need it. Most importantly, Due keeps me focused on doing things, and not setting myself up to do things, which is precisely what technology should be doing.

Ready to <a href=\"http://www.t-mobile.com/shop/phones/\">think pink</a>? Scrappy fourth-place US cell carrier <a href=\"http://www.t-mobile.com/shop/phones/\">T-Mobile</a> is eager to serve; the company's <a href=\"http://www.t-mobile.com/shop/phones/\">pre-order run for the iPhone 5 has launched today</a>. Phones will ship to customers on April 12.</p><p>
Last week, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2013/03/26/iphone-5-att-aws-unlocked-plans-t-mobile/\">Engadget confirmed</a> that the T-Mobile model of the iPhone 5 -- which will be available <em>unlocked</em> from Apple -- carries the same A1428 model number as the current AT&amp;T / GSM domestic model.</p><p>
There is a critical tweak, however, for the new carrier: <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2013/03/26/iphone-5-att-aws-unlocked-plans-t-mobile/\">the iPhone 5 now will support the 1700 MHz HSPA+/AWS uplink band</a>, which will enable higher performance on T-Mobile's UMTS Band IV network. Older GSM iPhone 5 units cannot get this fix via software; it's a chip change.</p><p>
While this means that iPhone 5 and 4S handsets unlocked and moved from AT&amp;T to T-Mobile can never get the highest performance on the UMTS bands, there's hope; the iPhone 5 LTE support for AWS will work just fine on T-Mobile. Now there's just the little question of building out that LTE network (see below).</p><p>
In contrast to the other three US cellphone carriers, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/04/technology/personaltech/t-mobile-breaks-free-of-cellphone-contracts-and-penalties.html?src=me&amp;ref=general&amp;_r=1&amp;\">T-Mobile has moved to overhaul</a> the most-despised feature of a phone plan: the contract. New subscribers have the option of buying the iPhone outright (starting at US$579 for a 16 GB model) or <a href=\"http://www.t-mobile.com/shop/phones/\">a $99 / $199 / $299 immediate charge</a>, just like the other carriers, followed by a payment plan of $20 a month for 24 months.</p><p>
At the end of that payback window, however, that $20 comes right off the top of your bill -- the phone is yours, so you don't have to keep paying for it. (Try asking for that deal with Verizon.) Of course, if you do decide to leave T-Mobile with the iPhone before the two-year window is up, you still owe the remaining balance of the purchase cost -- but you don't pay a separate early termination fee (ETF).</p><p>
Regarding 4G and LTE, T-Mobile's US network uses UMTS / HSPA+ \"3.5 G\" to achieve download speeds ranging up towards the 10 Mbit/sec threshold -- <a href=\"http://www.phonescoop.com/articles/article.php?a=376&amp;p=2707\">real-world performance</a> may vary. That doesn't really compete with the <a href=\"http://www.speedtest.net/wave/76af0b8b0274b40f\">observed</a> or <a href=\"http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9224364/AT_T_vs._Verizon_LTE_showdown_in_the_Big_Apple\">best-possible LTE performance</a> on Verizon, AT&amp;T or Sprint (yes, there are spots in NYC where you can get 40+ Mbit/sec download speeds).</p><p>
If you're in the mood for crazy-fast LTE wireless on T-Mobile, you have to wait. <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2013/03/26/t-mobile-announces-first-lte-markets/\">T-Mobile's LTE buildout is covering only seven cities so far</a>, with more coming this summer and fall. Interestingly, the specs page for the iPhone 5 on T-Mobile's site only mentions GSM and UMTS (in the I and IV bands), with no discussion of LTE.

	Ready to <a href=\"http://www.t-mobile.com/shop/phones/\">think pink</a>? Scrappy fourth-place US cell carrier <a href=\"http://www.t-mobile.com/shop/phones/\">T-Mobile</a> is eager to serve; the company's <a href=\"http://www.t-mobile.com/shop/phones/\">pre-order run for the iPhone 5 has launched today</a>. Phones will ship to customers on April 12.</p><p>
	Last week, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2013/03/26/iphone-5-att-aws-unlocked-plans-t-mobile/\">Engadget confirmed</a> that the T-Mobile model of the iPhone 5 -- which will be available <em>unlocked</em> from Apple -- carries the same A1428 model number as the current AT&amp;T / GSM domestic model.</p><p>
	There is a critical tweak, however, for the new carrier: <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2013/03/26/iphone-5-att-aws-unlocked-plans-t-mobile/\">the iPhone 5 now will support the 1700 MHz HSPA+/AWS uplink band</a>, which will enable higher performance on T-Mobile's UMTS Band IV network. Older GSM iPhone 5 units cannot get this fix via software; it's a chip change.</p><p>
	While this means that iPhone 5 and 4S handsets unlocked and moved from AT&amp;T to T-Mobile can never get the highest performance on the UMTS bands, there's hope; the iPhone 5 LTE support for AWS will work just fine on T-Mobile. Now there's just the little question of building out that LTE network (see below).</p><p>
	In contrast to the other three US cellphone carriers, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/04/technology/personaltech/t-mobile-breaks-free-of-cellphone-contracts-and-penalties.html?src=me&amp;ref=general&amp;_r=1&amp;\">T-Mobile has moved to overhaul</a> the most-despised feature of a phone plan: the contract. New subscribers have the option of buying the iPhone outright (starting at US$579 for a 16 GB model) or <a href=\"http://www.t-mobile.com/shop/phones/\">a $99 / $199 / $299 immediate charge</a>, just like the other carriers, followed by a payment plan of $20 a month for 24 months.</p><p>
	At the end of that payback window, however, that $20 comes right off the top of your bill -- the phone is yours, so you don't have to keep paying for it. (Try asking for that deal with Verizon.) Of course, if you do decide to leave T-Mobile with the iPhone before the two-year window is up, you still owe the remaining balance of the purchase cost -- but you don't pay a separate early termination fee (ETF).</p><p>
	Regarding 4G and LTE, T-Mobile's US network uses UMTS / HSPA+ \"3.5 G\" to achieve download speeds ranging up towards the 10 Mbit/sec threshold -- <a href=\"http://www.phonescoop.com/articles/article.php?a=376&amp;p=2707\">real-world performance</a> may vary. That doesn't really compete with the <a href=\"http://www.speedtest.net/wave/76af0b8b0274b40f\">observed</a> or <a href=\"http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9224364/AT_T_vs._Verizon_LTE_showdown_in_the_Big_Apple\">best-possible LTE performance</a> on Verizon, AT&amp;T or Sprint (yes, there are spots in NYC where you can get 40+ Mbit/sec download speeds).</p><p>
	If you're in the mood for crazy-fast LTE wireless on T-Mobile, you have to wait. <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2013/03/26/t-mobile-announces-first-lte-markets/\">T-Mobile's LTE buildout is covering only seven cities so far</a>, with more coming this summer and fall. Interestingly, the specs page for the iPhone 5 on T-Mobile's site only mentions GSM and UMTS (in the I and IV bands), with no discussion of LTE. That isn't a reflection of the actual hardware capabilities, but more likely a marketing consideration -- poor form to push LTE capability as a feature only available to a few customers.</p><p>

Theoretically, you can buy a T-Mobile iPhone 5 and use it with LTE on <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2013/03/26/iphone-5-att-aws-unlocked-plans-t-mobile/\">almost any carrier in the world</a>, which should make globetrotters very happy.</p><p><em>Updated to clarify that the phone purchase plans do carry an initial charge.</em></p><p>

But Corona also has a following out there. It's <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2010/04/14/360idev-ansca-mobiles-corona-sdk/\">a Software Development Kit</a> (SDK) that has been updated quite a bit lately, and I did hear a few devs say it's what they use to make their titles. One game development student even told me he's being taught how to use Corona specifically at school, so the tool definitely has its fans.</p><p>
Today, Corona has announced that it's hoping to make its platform more accessible than ever, with <a href=\"http://www.coronalabs.com/blog/2013/04/04/state-of-corona-new-public-release-free-re-imagining-pro/\">a new \"SDK Starter\" program</a> that will allow developers to make and sell apps with Corona for completely free. The SDK is available as a free download, and as long as you don't need certain features (like in-app purchases or analytics services), you can publish apps made with Corona for exactly zero dollars. Some other SDKs require you to use a certain splash screen on your app or advertise the service in some other way, but Corona's new program doesn't even require that -- it's really free.</p><p>
Of course, the company does offer those other services, and more, <a href=\"http://www.coronalabs.com/store/\">with a Pro account</a>. Corona also says it's \"re-imagining\" what Pro will mean for the service, which essentially means a price raise, to US$599 a year on May 1. The current subscription is $349, and anyone can still get one at that price until the first of May. Pro users will have access to in-app purchases and various analytics, as well as the option to use Corona's high-end graphic features, and the plugin system.</p><p>
But even if you're not interested in a full Pro subscription, it's nice to see that Corona's offering the free option for developers to try out the service for themselves.

But Corona also has a following out there. It's <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2010/04/14/360idev-ansca-mobiles-corona-sdk/\">a Software Development Kit</a> (SDK) that has been updated quite a bit lately, and I did hear a few devs say it's what they use to make their titles. One game development student even told me he's being taught how to use Corona specifically at school, so the tool definitely has its fans.</p><p>
	Today, Corona has announced that it's hoping to make its platform more accessible than ever, with <a href=\"http://www.coronalabs.com/blog/2013/04/04/state-of-corona-new-public-release-free-re-imagining-pro/\">a new \"SDK Starter\" program</a> that will allow developers to make and sell apps with Corona for completely free. The SDK is available as a free download, and as long as you don't need certain features (like in-app purchases or analytics services), you can publish apps made with Corona for exactly zero dollars. Some other SDKs require you to use a certain splash screen on your app or advertise the service in some other way, but Corona's new program doesn't even require that -- it's really free.</p><p>
	Of course, the company does offer those other services, and more, <a href=\"http://www.coronalabs.com/store/\">with a Pro account</a>. Corona also says it's \"re-imagining\" what Pro will mean for the service, which essentially means a price raise, to US$599 a year on May 1. The current subscription is $349, and anyone can still get one at that price until the first of May. Pro users will have access to in-app purchases and various analytics, as well as the option to use Corona's high-end graphic features, and the plugin system.</p><p>
	But even if you're not interested in a full Pro subscription, it's nice to see that Corona's offering the free option for developers to try out the service for themselves. Unity, I would say, is still the leader in this area, and they <a href=\"https://store.unity3d.com/\">offer a free version of the tools</a> for developers to try. But you do need to pay to publish a commercial game on that platform, so maybe Corona will grab a few more users (and see a few more published titles) with this free opportunity.</p><p style=\"padding:5px;clear:both;\"><a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2013/04/04/corona-introduces-an-sdk-starter-will-raise-pro-price-to-599/\">Corona introduces an SDK starter, will raise Pro price to $599</a> originally appeared on <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com\">TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog</a> on Thu, 04 Apr 2013 22:00:00 EST.

One of my favorite things about the App Store is that it can offer some completely original and crazy ideas. Developers do have to get approval from Apple to be published, but that approval doesn't require a game to make sense or be clear, only that it works as advertised. <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/badland/id535176909?mt=8\">Badland</a> is one such product of this system. It's a wild and wacky, totally alien experience that I don't think would get published anywhere else but on a platform such as the App Store.</p><p>
It's a platformer of sorts. You guide a little creature with some weird, flappy arms through a 2D environment on an alien planet, touching the screen to send him flapping upwards and releasing it to let him float back down. I don't know what your creature's name is, or even what he is -- the game works without words, communicating the premise and the story entirely through gameplay. But as you move through the levels, avoiding dangers as best you can, you collect various objects that give you other abilities: You can split the little guy into a few different creatures, grow or shrink him, or speed him up or slow him down.</p><p>
That's just in the first levels. Badland is simply oozing with creativity, both in terms of the gameplay situations it throws at you, but also in that incredible art. The actual levels are essentially drawn in black 2D outlines, but the game's background is a colorful, crazy planet, full of life that seems completely alien. The game's audio is very impressive as well -- you can clearly hear each clank and thump as your creature bounces his way through the world, and the ambient sound is also very well done.</p><p><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/badland/id535176909?mt=8\">Badland</a> is a treat, and we're lucky to have it. It's available for US$3.99, and as far as I'm concerned, it's a must-play game.

If you've been listening to the rumor mill lately, you might mistakenly assume that iPhone sales are plummeting. Indeed, a head-scratching and yet oft-repeated argument making the rounds these days suggests that Apple needs to behave more like Samsung if it wants to remain competitive in the smartphone market.</p><p>
The cold hard data, however, paints a much different picture.</p><p>
Recent data released by comScore shows that Apple's share of the smartphone market is growing while Samsung's is down ever so slightly.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\" \" src=\"http://www.blogcdn.com/www.tuaw.com/media/2013/04/iphone-feb-marketshare-1365107028.png\" style=\"width: 465px; height: 257px;\" /></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12pt;\">From December through February, Apple's average share of the smartphone market went up from 35% to 38.9%. Samsung's share, meanwhile, went up only slightly, from 20.3% to 21.3%. </span></p><p>
comScore's results also reveal that every other handset maker experienced a decline in marketshare over the past few months. It goes without saying that the smartphone market is currently a two horse race between Apple and Samsung. But again, the data indicates that Apple's share of the smartphone market is growing faster than Samsung's.</p><p>
The story is even rosier for Apple when we look at overall platform marketshare. <span style=\"font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12pt;\">Here we see that Apple's share during the three month period tracked by comScore went up by 3.9% to finish at 38.9%. And while Google's Android platform still reigns supreme with a 51.7% share, it's total marketshare actually decreased by 2 percentage points.</span></p><p>
And lest you think this is a one time occurrence, previous data released by comScore suggests a more entrenched pattern. To wit, Google's share of smartphone subscribers for the three month period ending in January of 2013 was 52.3% while Apple's was 37.8%.</p><p>
So for each of the last 3 three-month periods, Google's platform marketshare has gone down sequentially while Apple's has risen from 35% to 37.8% and now 38.9%.</p><p>
As a final point of interest, note how Google and Apple together account for 90.6% of all smartphone users.</p><p style=\"padding:5px;clear:both;\"><a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2013/04/04/iphone-marketshare-continues-to-increase-according-to-latest-com/\">iPhone marketshare continues to increase according to latest comScore reports</a> originally appeared on <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com\">TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog</a> on Thu, 04 Apr 2013 19:30:00 EST.

	Recent data released by comScore shows that Apple's share of the smartphone market is growing while Samsung's is down ever so slightly.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\" \" src=\"http://www.blogcdn.com/www.tuaw.com/media/2013/04/iphone-feb-marketshare-1365107028.png\" style=\"width: 465px; height: 257px;\" /></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12pt;\">From December through February, Apple's average share of the smartphone market went up from 35% to 38.9%. Samsung's share, meanwhile, went up only slightly, from 20.3% to 21.3%. </span></p><p>
	comScore's results also reveal that every other handset maker experienced a decline in marketshare over the past few months. It goes without saying that the smartphone market is currently a two horse race between Apple and Samsung. But again, the data indicates that Apple's share of the smartphone market is growing faster than Samsung's.</p><p>
	The story is even rosier for Apple when we look at overall platform marketshare. <span style=\"font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12pt;\">Here we see that Apple's share during the three month period tracked by comScore went up by 3.9% to finish at 38.9%. And while Google's Android platform still reigns supreme with a 51.7% share, it's total marketshare actually decreased by 2 percentage points.</span></p><p>
	And lest you think this is a one time occurrence, previous data released by comScore suggests a more entrenched pattern. To wit, Google's share of smartphone subscribers for the three month period ending in January of 2013 was 52.3% while Apple's was 37.8%.</p><p>
	So for each of the last 3 three-month periods, Google's platform marketshare has gone down sequentially while Apple's has risen from 35% to 37.8% and now 38.9%.</p><p>
	As a final point of interest, note how Google and Apple together account for 90.6% of all smartphone users.</p><p style=\"padding:5px;clear:both;\"><a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2013/04/04/iphone-marketshare-continues-to-increase-according-to-latest-com/\">iPhone marketshare continues to increase according to latest comScore reports</a> originally appeared on <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com\">TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog</a> on Thu, 04 Apr 2013 19:30:00 EST.

To call <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kay\">Alan Kay</a> brilliant is an understatement.</p><p>
Kay, in case you're unfamiliar with his work, is a Turing Award winner who played an integral role in the development of object-oriented programming. A highly respected computer scientist, Kay worked for many years at Xerox's famed Palo Alto Research Center and also did a stint as an Apple fellow in the company's Advanced Technology Group during the '80s and '90s.</p><p>
The full extent of Kay's visionary prowess can be found in a <a href=\"http://www.mprove.de/diplom/gui/kay72.html\">1972 research paper</a> he wrote titled, \"A Personal Computer for Children of All Ages.\"</p><p>
The research paper describes a device Kay dubbed the Dynabook, a notebook sized device with functionality remarkably similar to what the iPad would eventually go on to become.</p><p>
To that end, Kay's vision for the Dynabook can in many ways be viewed as the not-so-ancient blueprint for modern day tablet computing. The device envisioned by Kay back in 1972 featured a display capable of displaying text and graphics, along with the ability to play several hours of audio files.</p><p>
Kay also envisioned, back in 1972 mind you, that the Dynabook would be able to connect to high bandwidth networks, download remote content and even offer a virtual keyboard if need be.</p><blockquote><p>
Suppose the display panel covers the full extent of the notebook surface. Any keyboard arrangement one might wish can then be displayed anywhere on the surface.</p></blockquote><p>
Steve Jobs made that same exact point when he unveiled the original iPhone back in 2007.</p><p>
[Pictured below: an illustration from Kay's research paper depicting kids playing with Dynabooks]</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Alan Kay has some choice criticisms about the iPad\" data-src-height=\"317\" data-src-width=\"465\" src=\"http://www.blogcdn.com/www.tuaw.com/media/2013/04/kids-with-dynabook.png\" style=\"margin:4px\" /></p><p>
Kay was probably one of the few people whose opinion Jobs deeply valued, and some of Jobs' favorite quotes are attributable to Kay.</p><p>
\"People who are really serious about software should make their own hardware\" and \"The best way to predict the future is to invent it\" are two that come to mind.</p><p>
All that said, one would imagine that Kay would be particularly thrilled with Apple's iPad, a device that eerily embodies many of his predictions almost 40 years later. <a href=\"http://techland.time.com/2013/04/02/an-interview-with-computing-pioneer-alan-kay/\">In a recent interview</a> with Time Magazine's David Greelish, Kay levied a few harsh criticisms on Apple's wildly popular tablet.</p><p>
According to Kay, Apple's iPad not only fails to live up to the promise outlined in his ridiculously ahead-of-his-time research paper, but betrays it to a certain extent.</p><blockquote><p>
For all media, the original intent was \"symmetric authoring and consuming.\" Isn't it crystal-clear that this last and most important service is quite lacking in today's computing for the general public? Apple with the iPad and iPhone goes even further and does not allow children to download an Etoy made by another child somewhere in the world. This could not be farther from the original intentions of the entire ARPA-IPTO/PARC community in the '60s and '70s. Apple's reasons for this are mostly bogus, and to the extent that security is an issue, what is insecure are the OSes supplied by the vendors (and the insecurities are the result of their own bad practices -- they are not necessary).</p></blockquote><p>
I'm not quite sure where Kay is coming from here. For instance, there are no shortage of stories of individuals who are sometimes <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2011/11/12/2556021/sixth-grader-ios-games-app-club-TEDx\">as young as 12</a> (if not younger) who learn how to program and subsequently release an app on iTunes, instantly making their work accessible to millions of iOS users across the world. There are also apps like <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/minecraft-pocket-edition/id479516143?mt=8\">Minecraft</a>, <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2012/03/13/daily-ipad-app-woodcraft-helps-you-design-your-next-building-pr/\">Woodcraft</a> and <a href=\"http://edengame.net\">Eden</a> which allow sharing of created objects and worlds.</p><p>
Kay also took issue with the iPad's user interface, calling it \"very poor in a myriad of ways.\"</p><p>
With Scott Forstall now out of the Apple mix, perhaps that leaves the door open for Kay to return to Apple and really spice things up.</p><p>
All kidding aside, Kay's entire interview with Time is worth a thorough read. Kay is incredibly sharp and insightful, and while he has a few bones to pick with the iPad, he shares a number of interesting perspectives on computing, education and business leadership.

According to Apple's patent, the sliding display would feature a touch-sensitive home button, and the way you'd get access to these apps would be to enter some specific combination of gestures on that button directly.

Today saw a number of big releases on the App Store worth trying out. Here's a quick roundup of some of the biggest new app releases.</p><ul><li>
Disney has released a game called <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mittens/id597701101?mt=8\">Mittens</a>, which looks impressive. It was put together by a company called Metrogames, so it's not a fully internal product. But most of Disney's work lately has been putting their own brands on titles like Temple Run, so it's good to see something with an original spin. It's available for US$0.99.</li><li><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dream-chaser/id552358995?mt=8\">Dream Chaser</a> is Chillingo's latest title, a very flashy endless-running game, also for 99 cents.</li><li><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lie-swatter/id594242191?mt=8\">Lie Swatter</a> is a new trivia game by Jellyvision, the makers of You Don't Know Jack. It's free to play.</li><li><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wraithborne/id568120845?mt=8\">Wraithborne</a> is an impressive new free-to-play action RPG from Crescent Moon Games.</li><li>
As mentioned yesterday, there's <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/injustice-gods-among-us/id575658129?mt=8\">a new app based on Injustice: Gods Among Us</a>, the upcoming console game featuring DC superheroes battling each other. It's also a free-to-play game.</li></ul><p>
Some excellent titles in there for sure. We'll have closer looks at a few of these coming up later on TUAW, but they're all available to go pick up right now if you're interested already.</p><p style=\"padding:5px;clear:both;\"><a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2013/04/04/disneys-mittens-the-other-brothers-and-more-now-available/\">Disney's Mittens, Dream Chaser and more now available</a> originally appeared on <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com\">TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog</a> on Thu, 04 Apr 2013 17:00:00 EST.

	Some excellent titles in there for sure.

Are you about to purchase an iPad?

There are definitely some bargains to be found on the full-sized iPad. A 64 GB WiFi + Cellular third-generation iPad was selling for US$779.99 at Best Buy and is now showing a sale price of $545.99. A 64 GB Wi-Fi model was going for $649.99 and is now a bargain at $454.99. Remember, the third-generation iPad includes a Retina display...</p><p>
While Best Buy retained regular pricing on the iPad mini, Walmart has done a price rollback on the 16 GB Wi-Fi model, knocking the price back to $299. MacMall has dropped the price on a large variety of iPad mini models, with cuts from $10 to $29 depending on the storage capacity and connectivity.</p><p style=\"padding:5px;clear:both;\"><a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2013/04/04/big-box-online-retailers-slash-ipad-prices/\">Big box, online retailers slash iPad prices</a> originally appeared on <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com\">TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog</a> on Thu, 04 Apr 2013 16:00:00 EST.

If you are like me, you do a lot of searching every day. Not just Google, but IMDb for movie info, Amazon, TED talks and even TUAW. To help out people like you and me, <a href=\"http://www.cynapse.com/phlo\">Cynapse Software</a> has introduced a nifty utility called <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/phlo/id547094813?mt=12\">Phlo</a>. It provides a pop-up search field that be assigned to a global hotkey and always ready to go.</p><p>
If you're looking to go beyond Google, there are dozens of combinations, and you can have multiple search engines selected. There's an extensive list of search portals buillt in, but you can add your own by simply providing a URL.</p><p>
In the open Phlo window, you can start to type the name of a search engine and it will pop up for one-time access. You never have to use your mouse, and multiple sites can be chosen with shift + return or shift + click if you want to use your mouse. Out of the box, Phlo is configured to pop up with option + spacebar, but you can define any key or combination. Apple Spotlight uses Command + Spacebar. The ESC key closes Phlo.</p><p>
After you've used Phlo for awhile, it becomes second nature. I found it to be a timesaver, because your searches begin with just a tap on the keyboard, and I find myself doing more searches because it is so easy to get them started. The only change I would make in this app is an ability to create groups of search engines for specific tasks, and have Phlo remember those groups.</p><p><div class=\"postgallery\"><p><strong>Gallery: <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/photos/phlo/\">Phlo</a></strong></p><a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/photos/phlo/#5790617\"><img src=\"http://www.blogcdn.com/www.tuaw.com/media/2013/04/phlo3_thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\" \" /></a><a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/photos/phlo/#5790618\"><img src=\"http://www.blogcdn.com/www.tuaw.com/media/2013/04/phlo2_thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\" \" /></a><a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/photos/phlo/#5790619\"><img src=\"http://www.blogcdn.com/www.tuaw.com/media/2013/04/phlo1_thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\" \" /></a></div></p><p>

In June of 2011, Steve Jobs <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2011/06/08/steve-jobs-unveils-new-apple-campus-that-literally-looks-like-a/\">stood before the Cupertino City Council</a> and announced Apple's desire to build a massive new campus on 98 acres of land it had previously acquired from Hewlett Packard.</p><p>
And by massive, I mean that it will have a <a href=\"http://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/calculating_the_size_of_apples_spaceship_hq/\">slightly larger footprint</a> than the Pentagon.</p><p>
Jobs explained that Apple was undergoing a period of tremendous growth and that it was renting buildings adjacent to its 1 Infinite Loop campus in order to house its ever-growing number of employees.</p><p>
\"We've rented every scrap of building we could find in Cupertino,\" Jobs previously noted.</p><p>
Apple's proposed new campus will be able to accommodate 12,000 employees, will feature an auditorium large enough to host WWDC-scale presentations and will sport a cafeteria capable of seating 3,000.</p><p>
As you can tell from the architectural renderings pictured above, the design of the new campus will be anchored by a large circular building.</p><p>
\"It's a little like a spaceship landed,\" Jobs explained to the council. \"It's got this gorgeous courtyard in the middle, but it's got a lot more.\"</p><p>
In typical Apple style, Jobs boasted that the planned structure would be comprised of curved glass.</p><p>
\"There's not a single straight piece of glass in this building,\" Jobs said at the time. \"We've used our experience in building retail buildings all over the world. We know how to make the biggest pieces of glass for architectural use. And, we want to make the glass specifically for this building here. We can make it curve all the way around the building... It's pretty cool.\"</p><p>
While Jobs initially hoped that the campus would be completed by 2015, things haven't exactly gone as planned. Apple hasn't even broken ground yet and the new campus likely won't be finished until 2016 at the earliest.</p><p>
What's more, BusinessWeek <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-04-04/apples-campus-2-shapes-up-as-an-investor-relations-nightmare#p1\">is reporting that Apple's initial US$3 billion budget</a> for the project has shot up to $5 billion.</p><blockquote><p>
Since 2011, the budget for Apple's Campus 2 has ballooned from less than $3 billion to nearly $5 billion, according to five people close to the project who were not authorized to speak on the record. If their consensus estimate is accurate, Apple's expansion would eclipse the $3.9 billion being spent on the new World Trade Center complex in New York, and the new office space would run more than $1,500 per square foot -- three times the cost of many top-of-the-line downtown corporate towers.</p></blockquote><p>
The report relays that one of the reasons for the delay is that Apple is still working with its lead architectural firm -- Foster + Partners -- to lower the budget by as much as $1 billion. Part of the cost overrun is due to Jobs' extremely particular taste with respect to materials.</p><blockquote><p>
As with Apple's products, Jobs wanted no seam, gap or paintbrush stroke showing; every wall, floor and even ceiling is to be polished to a supernatural smoothness. All of the interior wood was to be harvested from a specific species of maple, and only the finer-quality \"heartwood\" at the center of the trees would be used, says one person briefed on the plan last year.</p></blockquote><p>
As it stands now, Apple will reportedly begin removing the 26 buildings which currently occupy the eventual landing spot for the \"spaceship\" this June.</p><p>
As a point of interest, Apple is doing all it can to make its new campus as green as possible. To that end, campus parking will be underground as to maintain the above-ground foliage while the roof will be comprised of 700,000 square feet of solar panels.</p><p style=\"padding:5px;clear:both;\"><a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2013/04/04/apples-planned-spaceship-campus-reportedly-2-billion-over-bu/\">Apple's planned 'spaceship' campus reportedly $2 billion over budget</a> originally appeared on <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com\">TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog</a> on Thu, 04 Apr 2013 13:00:00 EST.

Every year around tax time, millions of small-business owners promise themselves that next year will be different.

Ultima Forever is one of the weirdest brand experiments I've seen pop up on iOS so far. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultima_(series)\">Ultima is</a>, of course, one of the oldest and best-loved RPG series in video games, with over a dozen different variations and versions. And EA has decided to bring the Ultima series to iOS with Ultima Forever, which is sort of a remake or reimagining of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultima_IV:_Quest_of_the_Avatar\">Ultima IV</a>, one of the most popular versions of Ultima.<br /><br />
\"Remake or reimagining\" is still sort of a simplification of exactly what this game is, and even after having seen and played it at GDC last week, it's still kind of tough to put down exactly how this game is related to Ultima IV and the rest of the series. There are some quests and storylines from the old game, and the graphics are related. But some of the quests are set years in the future, as if it's a sequel to the old title. And some of the gameplay ideas are taken directly from the old game (it's a fantasy action RPG that has to do with you as a character questing up to try and become the Avatar while honing your various values like Honesty and Honor), but others are very new: There are some freemium elements to this title, and it's an MMO, so you'll see other players questing around you as you play, and you'll be able to team up with friends while taking down dungeons.<br /><br />
In other words, Ultima Forever is a weird one. It is fun -- the game offers up a lot of really interesting content, and while the combat is tight and fun, there's also some interesting questlines to follow, and stories to discover around the world that should appeal to both old and new Ultima players. There's a nice amount of complexity in the leveling as well, with new gear to discover and equip and plenty of reputations and attributes to grind out and grow more powerful in.<br /><br />
At the same time, however, EA has integrated some freemium elements into the game, which can get annoying very quickly. As you play through the dungeon, you earn keys, which can then be used at various points to open chests and give you a random chance at some loot. The lowest quality keys can be easy to find, and they will award you some (relatively cheap) loot. But higher quality keys are rarer, and some will need to be purchased with real money, and then used to unlock ability slots or better gear.<br /><br />
Even in the few minutes I had to play through the game at GDC, dealing with the keys was an annoying pain, and it's frustrating that EA here isn't willing to just let players play with the game directly, instead inserting this currency mechanic at every turn. It's still too early to pass judgment on the finished title, but the keys seem like a bad mark on an otherwise very impressive game. Older Ultima players, especially, might be really disappointed to see their old memories tarnished with constant, cheap attempts to sell in-app currency.<br /><br />
Perhaps that's too harsh, though -- the game's not done yet, and it's going to go through a thorough beta period before it finally arrives worldwide later on this summer. Hopefully, EA will tune it right, so that those who fondly remember Ultima can enjoy this celebration of it without being constantly pestered with freemium nonsense.</p><p style=\"padding:5px;clear:both;\"><a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2013/04/03/ultima-forever-looks-impressive-but-may-have-some-freemium-prob/\">Ultima Forever looks impressive, but may have some freemium problems</a> originally appeared on <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com\">TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog</a> on Wed, 03 Apr 2013 22:00:00 EST.

Developer David Frampton is one of our favorites around here at TUAW -- he made a big splash on the App Store a while ago with <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2010/06/15/wwdc-2010-hands-on-with-chopper-2/\">Chopper 2</a>, but these days he's working on a huge sandbox app he's made called <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/the-blockheads/id519596406?mt=8\">The Blockheads</a>, which is a Minecraft-style game where you can explore a world with the titular characters, making and building items and contraptions from the items that you can find and collect.</p><p>
The Blockheads is doing very well for Frampton -- he says the game has seen over four million downloads so far, and it's definitely the biggest project he's ever worked on. The game's gotten even bigger after a recent update that allowed \"backgrounding,\" too. When the game first arrived, you had to basically watch your Blockheads perform their tasks, and leaving the app caused the task to pause as well. <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2013/01/15/daily-iphone-app-the-blockheads-is-another-great-take-on-sandbo/\">I mentioned this in the game's inital review</a>, and while the game was still a lot of fun, longer tasks could be very annoying.</p><p>
Frampton says he agrees that requiring the app to stay open while those tasks were running could be annoying, but during the game's initial development, he just wasn't sure if backgrounding could work, \"whether I could do that or not.\" The game's monetization depends on using time crystals to skip past tasks as well, and Frampton included the ability to bring in a few different characters at a time, which he hoped would help people with the waiting periods.</p><p>
Unfortunately, he says, \"only 1% of players warped in a second Blockhead,\" which means that most of his players didn't use the tools he'd given them to make the waiting more bearable. That convinced him he had to find a solution, and the backgrounding patch went in recently (along with a price drop on actually bringing in a second character). Frampton says the change has helped him, both with exposure for the app as well as growing the audience. \"Everything doubled,\" he says about making the change.</p><p>
As for what's next in Blockheads, Frampton has a huge list of features, both from things he wants to do as well as fan requests. There's a tutorial coming into the game, to smooth out the initial player experience, which he feels can still be a bit confusing. Fans on the message boards have asked him for the ability to create signs (because right now there's no way to see what's in the game's chests until you open them up), but Frampton isn't sure that's a good idea. He's more interested in providing \"shelves,\" which would be storage items where you can see exactly what's being stored at just a glance.</p><p>
Currently, there is two-player local multiplayer, but Frampton says that Game Center is really causing problems with any larger multiplayer game, as the system is not very good at keeping game sessions running when one player leaves or enters. So multiplayer is up in the air for now, though Frampton says it's definitely a possibility at some point in the future.</p><p>
In other future plans, he says he'd love to bring more complicated machinery to the game, like copper wiring, elevators, and even electricity. Fans have asked for more goals, so he'll be filling out the endgame as well. But unlike Minecraft, says Frampton, he doesn't want the game to \"end\" at all. \"I can keep adding more and more games to it,\" he told me. One idea he has is to allow players to build up technology to the point where they can travel to other worlds, which would obviously open up a whole new set of resources and areas to explore.</p><p>
That's all in the distant future of the game, however -- Frampton is just brainstorming ideas, not simply working on actual features for that yet. Still, The Blockheads is definitely a popular title, and Frampton says he personally is excited by the process of creating and developing this game, in a way that he wasn't with Chopper 2 or his other titles. If you haven't gone to check out The Blockheads yet, you can <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/the-blockheads/id519596406?mt=8\">find it on the App Store</a> for free right now.</p><p style=\"padding:5px;clear:both;\"><a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2013/04/03/majic-jungles-the-blockheads-charges-on/\">Majic Jungle's The Blockheads charges on</a> originally appeared on <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com\">TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog</a> on Wed, 03 Apr 2013 21:30:00 EST.

	Developer David Frampton is one of our favorites around here at TUAW -- he made a big splash on the App Store a while ago with <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2010/06/15/wwdc-2010-hands-on-with-chopper-2/\">Chopper 2</a>, but these days he's working on a huge sandbox app he's made called <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/the-blockheads/id519596406?mt=8\">The Blockheads</a>, which is a Minecraft-style game where you can explore a world with the titular characters, making and building items and contraptions from the items that you can find and collect.</p><p>
	The Blockheads is doing very well for Frampton -- he says the game has seen over four million downloads so far, and it's definitely the biggest project he's ever worked on. The game's gotten even bigger after a recent update that allowed \"backgrounding,\" too. When the game first arrived, you had to basically watch your Blockheads perform their tasks, and leaving the app caused the task to pause as well. <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2013/01/15/daily-iphone-app-the-blockheads-is-another-great-take-on-sandbo/\">I mentioned this in the game's inital review</a>, and while the game was still a lot of fun, longer tasks could be very annoying.</p><p>
	Frampton says he agrees that requiring the app to stay open while those tasks were running could be annoying, but during the game's initial development, he just wasn't sure if backgrounding could work, \"whether I could do that or not.\" The game's monetization depends on using time crystals to skip past tasks as well, and Frampton included the ability to bring in a few different characters at a time, which he hoped would help people with the waiting periods.</p><p>
	Unfortunately, he says, \"only 1% of players warped in a second Blockhead,\" which means that most of his players didn't use the tools he'd given them to make the waiting more bearable. That convinced him he had to find a solution, and the backgrounding patch went in recently (along with a price drop on actually bringing in a second character). Frampton says the change has helped him, both with exposure for the app as well as growing the audience. \"Everything doubled,\" he says about making the change.</p><p>
	As for what's next in Blockheads, Frampton has a huge list of features, both from things he wants to do as well as fan requests. There's a tutorial coming into the game, to smooth out the initial player experience, which he feels can still be a bit confusing. Fans on the message boards have asked him for the ability to create signs (because right now there's no way to see what's in the game's chests until you open them up), but Frampton isn't sure that's a good idea. He's more interested in providing \"shelves,\" which would be storage items where you can see exactly what's being stored at just a glance.</p><p>
	Currently, there is two-player local multiplayer, but Frampton says that Game Center is really causing problems with any larger multiplayer game, as the system is not very good at keeping game sessions running when one player leaves or enters. So multiplayer is up in the air for now, though Frampton says it's definitely a possibility at some point in the future.</p><p>
	In other future plans, he says he'd love to bring more complicated machinery to the game, like copper wiring, elevators, and even electricity. Fans have asked for more goals, so he'll be filling out the endgame as well. But unlike Minecraft, says Frampton, he doesn't want the game to \"end\" at all. \"I can keep adding more and more games to it,\" he told me. One idea he has is to allow players to build up technology to the point where they can travel to other worlds, which would obviously open up a whole new set of resources and areas to explore.</p><p>
	That's all in the distant future of the game, however -- Frampton is just brainstorming ideas, not simply working on actual features for that yet. Still, The Blockheads is definitely a popular title, and Frampton says he personally is excited by the process of creating and developing this game, in a way that he wasn't with Chopper 2 or his other titles.

In April 2012, security researchers discovered a new piece of malware targeting OS X users. The <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2012/04/05/how-to-find-remove-the-flashback-trojan/\">malware was dubbed \"Flashback\"</a> and reportedly infected more than 600,000 Mac users, including about 200 machines on Apple's Cupertino campus. The malware was able to infect so many machines because it was cleverly masqueraded as a fake Adobe Flash installer.</p><p>
Once active, the malware would inject ads from pay-per-click providers into search results instead of sourcing the ads from Google. The security firm Symantec estimated that the malware had the potential to net its creators upwards of US$10,000 a day, but further analysis<span style=\"font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12pt;\"></span><a href=\"http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/osxflashback-how-turn-your-botnet\" style=\"font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12pt;\">indicated that the actual payout</a><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12pt;\"> was much lower.</span></p><blockquote><p>
From our analysis we have seen that, for a three-week period starting in April, the botnet displayed over 10 million ads on compromised computers but only a small percentage of users who were shown ads actually clicked them, with close to 400,000 ads being clicked. These numbers earned the attackers $14,000 in these three weeks, although it is worth mentioning that earning the money is only one part of the puzzle -- actually collecting that money is another, often more difficult, job. Many PPC providers employ anti-fraud measures and affiliate-verification processes before paying.</p></blockquote><p>
About a week after the malware was first publicized, Apple issued a software update to remove the malware from affected machines.</p><p>
Over the past few months, investigative reporter and former Washington Post journalist Brian Krebs <a href=\"http://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/04/who-wrote-the-flashback-os-x-worm/\">did a bit of sleuthing</a> and was able to piece together a number of clues which purport to reveal the identity of the man behind the Flashback malware.</p><p>
By lurking on forum threads on a Russian-language site dedicated to black-hat SEO, the art of deceptively manipulating search results for monetary gain, Krebs was eventually able to acquire some revealing information.</p><p>
In a private message obtained by Krebs, he found that one user with the handle \"mavook\" was looking to get an invitation to Darkod, a cybercrime forum. In order to prove his bonafides, mavook took responsibility for the Flashback botnet while boasting that he specializes \"in finding exploits and creating bots.\"</p><p>
Krebs adds:</p><blockquote><p>
The senior member that Mavook petitions is quite well-known in the Russian cybercrime underground, and these two individuals also are well-known to one another. In fact, in a separate exchange on the main BlackSEO forum between the senior member and a BlackSEO user named JPS, the senior member recommends Mavook as a guy who knows his stuff and can be counted on to produce reliable attack tools.</p></blockquote><p>
Following that, Krebs took a look at mavook's profile page and saw that his personal homepage was at one point mavook.com. Krebs was then able to look at old WHOIS registration records and come up with a name -- Maxim Selikhanovich, a 30-year-old from Saransk, Russia.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; line-height: 12pt;\">The full details behind Krebs' investigation are rather interesting and worth checking out in their entirety.</span></p><p style=\"padding:5px;clear:both;\"><a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2013/04/03/security-researcher-brian-krebs-outs-the-man-behind-the-flashbac/\">Security Researcher Brian Krebs outs the man behind the Flashback malware</a> originally appeared on <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com\">TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog</a> on Wed, 03 Apr 2013 21:00:00 EST.

Vdio is a pay-per-view service, unlike its sister program's \"all you can eat\" subscription model. The service builds off Rdio's social focus with Sets, playlists for TV shows and movies that make it easy to share and discover new content to watch. Furthering the social theme of the service is the ability to check out what your friends are watching at a given moment and jump into the program with them.</p><p>
A service is only as strong as its content, but Vdio features most of the latest releases from the big screen to network television. Current titles range from movies such as <em>Zero Dark Thirty</em> to <em>The Hobbit</em> and <em>Skyfall</em>, while popular television programs such as <em>Breaking Bad</em>, <em>Homeland</em> and <em>Downton Abbey</em> make up the broadcast front. TV shows are available to stream the day after they air, and subscribing to a whole season provides a discounted price. The service doesn't have a deal worked out with HBO, meaning you'll have to look elsewhere to catch up on <em>Game of Thrones</em>.</p><p>
At the moment the service is only available to Rdio Unlimited subscribers in the US and UK. Current subscribers, or anyone who subscribes in the next 60 days, will receive a US$25 credit towards the service to try it out.</p><p>
Vdio is currently only available on the iPad or online. Other devices and platforms will be added in the future. Curiously, the iPad app does not allow users to rent or download content, but rather only allows for streaming things that have already been purchased.</p><p style=\"padding:5px;clear:both;\"><a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2013/04/03/rdio-introduces-social-video-streaming-service-vdio/\">Rdio introduces social video streaming service Vdio</a> originally appeared on <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com\">TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog</a> on Wed, 03 Apr 2013 20:00:00 EST.

The controls are interesting -- rather than using virtual controls, you simply tap on the screen to move around, and then again to attack.

The game can be very harsh, in that when you die, that's essentially the end of that character.
