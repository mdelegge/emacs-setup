Sounds scary until you spell out the formula, which is H<sub>2</sub>O. Or plain water.

According to a <a href=\"http://www.wtsp.com/news/watercooler/article/308374/58/Drinking-water-April-Fools-joke-falls-flat\">local news report</a>, the two have made foolery an annual event but have always managed to keep it family friendly. This year, the duo turned to dihydrogen monoxide, warning their listeners that the local water supply is full of the stuff. Naturally, worried phone calls to the local water authority ensued.</p><p>The article quotes a member of the local county utility, who became aware of the broadcast only when nervous customers started getting in touch: \"We were fielding calls and letting people know that water was safe.\" Meanwhile, neither the local authorities nor the radio station management were amused. \"My understanding is it is a felony to call in a false water quality issue,\" the article quotes county spokesperson Diane Holm as saying. The radio station has disavowed the broadcast and suspended the DJs.</p></div><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/04/dihydrogen-monoxide-joke-gets-djs-suspended/#p3n\">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/04/dihydrogen-monoxide-joke-gets-djs-suspended/?comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=Sxili56bb2c:hoPi3WxqOs4:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=Sxili56bb2c:hoPi3WxqOs4:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=Sxili56bb2c:hoPi3WxqOs4:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=Sxili56bb2c:hoPi3WxqOs4:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=Sxili56bb2c:hoPi3WxqOs4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=Sxili56bb2c:hoPi3WxqOs4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/science/~4/Sxili56bb2c\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/04/dihydrogen-monoxide-joke-gets-djs-suspended/feed/") (slash:comments nil "0") (feedburner:origLink nil "http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/04/dihydrogen-monoxide-joke-gets-djs-suspended/")) (item nil (title nil "Mechanical computer flexes its muscle") (link nil "http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~r/arstechnica/science/~3/h53CXBj93eY/") (comments nil "http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/04/reflexive-computer-is-a-turing-machine-made-with-artificial-muscle/#comments") (pubDate nil "Fri, 05 Apr 2013 12:30:18 +0000") (dc:creator nil "Chris Lee") (category nil "Scientific Method") (category nil "Uncategorized") (category nil "artificial muscles") (category nil "biomimetics") (category nil "mechanical computers") (guid ((isPermaLink .

Indeed, many physicists believed that the world was essentially mechanical and deterministic. More importantly, everyone was thinking about mechanical solutions to problems. In that milieu, it seemed natural to think of computing in terms of gears, chains, sprockets, and cams. The result was mechanical computers.</p><p>Once the electronics revolution hit full stride, these machines ended up being remembered as the pinnacle of a bygone age. Now, in a blast from the past, a pair of researchers from New Zealand have <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4793648\">demonstrated</a> an updated version of the mechanical computer: an artificial, muscle-based computer. It's slow and bulky, and it can't do a lot, but the researchers argue that it has great potential for robotics.</p><p>To implement their computer, the researchers returned to the original work of Alan Turing, who envisioned a computer as a read-write head that operated on a linear tape. The write operations depend on the results of read operations and whatever program might be in memory. This machine can, in principle, solve any problem that is solvable by a computer and is known as a universal Turing machine, of which modern computers are an example.</p></div><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/04/reflexive-computer-is-a-turing-machine-made-with-artificial-muscle/#p3n\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/04/reflexive-computer-is-a-turing-machine-made-with-artificial-muscle/?comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=h53CXBj93eY:OlP4IuqnyEU:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=h53CXBj93eY:OlP4IuqnyEU:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=h53CXBj93eY:OlP4IuqnyEU:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=h53CXBj93eY:OlP4IuqnyEU:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=h53CXBj93eY:OlP4IuqnyEU:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=h53CXBj93eY:OlP4IuqnyEU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/science/~4/h53CXBj93eY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/04/reflexive-computer-is-a-turing-machine-made-with-artificial-muscle/feed/") (slash:comments nil "0") (enclosure ((url .

A new observation using the Hubble Space Telescope identified the farthest type Ia supernova yet seen, at a distance of greater than 10 billion light-years. In the tradition of supernova surveys, this event was nicknamed for Woodrow Wilson, 28th President of the United States. The previous record-holder, Supernova Mingus, was about 350 million light-years closer to Earth.</p><p>White dwarfs are the remains of stars similar in mass to the Sun. Since such a star would have to live out its entire life to form a white dwarf, there are limits to how early in the Universe's history a type Ia supernova can explode. Only 8 white dwarf supernovas have been identified farther than 9 billion light-years away. (Some core-collapse supernovas, which are the explosions of very massive stars, have been seen farther than Supernova Wilson.) Since all such explosions happen in a similar way, cosmologists use them to measure the expansion rate of the Universe.</p><p>Astronomers found this violent event by comparing the light from several separate long exposures of the same patch of the sky, known as CANDELS (the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey). Bright as it was, the distance was so great that Supernova Wilson appeared as an enhancement of the luminosity of its host galaxy. The researchers subtracted the light of the galaxy without the supernova from the combined supernova-galaxy combination, then analyzed the residual light to identify it as type Ia.</p></div><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/04/hubble-telescope-spots-death-of-a-white-dwarf-10-billion-years-ago/#p3n\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/04/hubble-telescope-spots-death-of-a-white-dwarf-10-billion-years-ago/?comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=1vBCYYONTRU:s4B-5AWdPlg:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=1vBCYYONTRU:s4B-5AWdPlg:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=1vBCYYONTRU:s4B-5AWdPlg:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=1vBCYYONTRU:s4B-5AWdPlg:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=1vBCYYONTRU:s4B-5AWdPlg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=1vBCYYONTRU:s4B-5AWdPlg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/science/~4/1vBCYYONTRU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/04/hubble-telescope-spots-death-of-a-white-dwarf-10-billion-years-ago/feed/") (slash:comments nil "0") (feedburner:origLink nil "http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/04/hubble-telescope-spots-death-of-a-white-dwarf-10-billion-years-ago/")) (item nil (title nil "Om nom nom: Black hole dismembers and eats a large planet") (link nil "http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~r/arstechnica/science/~3/8_vWT_gMiKc/") (comments nil "http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/04/om-nom-nom-black-hole-dismembers-and-eats-a-large-planet/#comments") (pubDate nil "Thu, 04 Apr 2013 17:50:23 +0000") (dc:creator nil "Matthew Francis") (category nil "Scientific Method") (category nil "astronomy") (category nil "astrophysics") (category nil "black holes") (category nil "Brown dwarf") (category nil "exoplanet") (category nil "supermassive black hole") (guid ((isPermaLink .

The maw of a black hole is indeed a potentially destructive thing, but most matter—including gas stripped from nearby stars—is not destined to end inside the black hole. Instead, a lot of it ends orbiting the black hole, and the energy that's released by the material that is getting swallowed blasts a lot of material back out into space. So, black holes don't simply devour every object that comes near them.</p><p>All of this makes a new observation particularly interesting. Astronomers M. Nikołajuk and R. Walter caught a black hole in the act of destroying and consuming part of a large planet or small brown dwarf. This event involved a supermassive black hole located in a relatively nearby galaxy, and emitted a burst of intense X-ray light that fluctuated over a short time span, then faded. The flare and its aftermath behaved as expected if the black hole disrupted an object at least 14 times Jupiter's mass, then consumed about 10 percent of the gas that once was part of the object.</p><p>In 2011, astronomers using the INTEGRAL (INTErnational Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory) gamma ray telescope discovered a strong source of emissions coming from the galaxy NGC 4845. Follow-up observations using INTEGRAL along with other gamma- and X-ray telescopes confirmed the flare was located within the central region of the galaxy, where the supermassive black hole resides.</p></div><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/04/om-nom-nom-black-hole-dismembers-and-eats-a-large-planet/#p3n\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/04/om-nom-nom-black-hole-dismembers-and-eats-a-large-planet/?comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=8_vWT_gMiKc:UoIV1Xrv850:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=8_vWT_gMiKc:UoIV1Xrv850:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=8_vWT_gMiKc:UoIV1Xrv850:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=8_vWT_gMiKc:UoIV1Xrv850:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=8_vWT_gMiKc:UoIV1Xrv850:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=8_vWT_gMiKc:UoIV1Xrv850:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/science/~4/8_vWT_gMiKc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/04/om-nom-nom-black-hole-dismembers-and-eats-a-large-planet/feed/") (slash:comments nil "0") (feedburner:origLink nil "http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/04/om-nom-nom-black-hole-dismembers-and-eats-a-large-planet/")) (item nil (title nil "Climate change may be irreversible, but we control the future trajectory") (link nil "http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~r/arstechnica/science/~3/0PJ2iWSiDrU/") (comments nil "http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/04/climate-change-may-be-irreversible-but-we-control-the-future-trajectory/#comments") (pubDate nil "Thu, 04 Apr 2013 14:40:34 +0000") (dc:creator nil "Allie Wilkinson") (category nil "Scientific Method") (category nil "carbon dioxide") (category nil "carbon emissions") (category nil "climate") (category nil "climate change") (category nil "climate commitment") (category nil "Climate science") (category nil "Climatology") (category nil "global climate change") (category nil "global temperatures") (category nil "global warming") (guid ((isPermaLink .

Currently, there have been nine confirmed infections that resulted in three deaths. However, there may be other infections that haven't come to the attention of health authorities, and the original source of the infections remains unknown.</p><p>This particular strain is called H7N9 (for more on the H/N nomenclature, see our <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/01/an-influenza-primer-updated-for-201213/\">influenza primer</a>). It's typically confined to birds, although <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2013/04/03/world/asia/china-bird-flu/index.html?hpt=hp_t2\">CNN notes</a> that H7N9 has infected humans a number of times in the past.

But that doesn't mean the technology is without its problems; lithium batteries have been implicated in some critical technological snafus, from exploding laptops to <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/business/2013/02/investigation-reveals-cause-of-battery-fire-on-boeing-787-dreamliner/\">grounded airplanes</a>. Most of these problems can be traced back to the electrolyte, a liquid that helps ions carry charges within the battery. Liquid electrolytes can leak, burn, and distort the internal structure of the battery, swelling it in ways that can lead to a catastrophic failure.</p><p>The solution, of course, would be to get rid of the liquids. But ions don't tend to move as easily through solids, which creates another set of problems. Now, researchers have formulated a solid in which lithium ions can move about five times faster than any previously described substance. Better yet, the solid—a close chemical relative of styrofoam—helps provide structural stability to the battery. Don't expect to see a styrofoam battery in your next cellphone though, as the material needs to be heated to 60°C in order to work.</p><p>The problem with liquid electrolytes has to do with the fact that, during recharging, lithium ions end up forming deposits of metal inside the battery. These create risks of short circuits (the problem that grounded Boeing's Dreamliner 787) and can damage the battery's structure, causing leaks and a fire risk. Solid electrodes get around this because the lithium ions will only come out of the electrolyte at specific locations within the solid, and can't form the large metal deposits that cause all of the problems.</p></div><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/04/solid-electrolyte-may-end-the-catastrophic-failures-of-lithium-batteries/#p3n\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/04/solid-electrolyte-may-end-the-catastrophic-failures-of-lithium-batteries/?comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=fN_vO3XUWVY:O7ATnJ-L_jM:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=fN_vO3XUWVY:O7ATnJ-L_jM:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=fN_vO3XUWVY:O7ATnJ-L_jM:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=fN_vO3XUWVY:O7ATnJ-L_jM:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=fN_vO3XUWVY:O7ATnJ-L_jM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=fN_vO3XUWVY:O7ATnJ-L_jM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/science/~4/fN_vO3XUWVY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/04/solid-electrolyte-may-end-the-catastrophic-failures-of-lithium-batteries/feed/") (slash:comments nil "0") (feedburner:origLink nil "http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/04/solid-electrolyte-may-end-the-catastrophic-failures-of-lithium-batteries/")) (item nil (title nil "Quantum encryption keys obtained from a moving plane") (link nil "http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~r/arstechnica/science/~3/6LytgL_gCrQ/") (comments nil "http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/04/quantum-encryption-keys-obtained-from-a-moving-plane/#comments") (pubDate nil "Tue, 02 Apr 2013 18:30:57 +0000") (dc:creator nil "John Timmer") (category nil "Risk Assessment") (category nil "Scientific Method") (category nil "optics") (category nil "Physics") (category nil "quantum ecryption") (category nil "quantum mechanics") (guid ((isPermaLink .

In many cases, that sort of deployment will be years away (assuming it ever happens). But in a couple of fields, the rapid pace of proof-of-principle demonstrations hints that commercialization isn't too far beyond the horizon.</p><p>One of these areas is quantum key distribution between places that aren't in close proximity. <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/science/2010/04/quantum-key-distribution-faster-and-more-meh-than-ever/\">Quantum keys</a> hold the promise of creating a unique, disposable key on demand in such a way that any attempts to eavesdrop will quickly become obvious. We know how to do this over relatively short distances using fiber optic cables, so the basic technique is well-established. Throughout the past couple of years, researchers have been getting rid of the cables: first by sending quantum information <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/science/2012/08/open-air-quantum-teleportation-performed-across-a-97km-lake/\">across a lake</a>, then by exchanging it <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/01/quantum-measurements-on-one-island-determine-behavior-on-another/\">between two islands</a>.</p><p>The latter feat involved a distance of 144km, which is getting closer to the sorts of altitudes occupied by satellites. But exchanging keys with satellites would seem to add a significant challenge—they move. Over the weekend, <em>Nature Photonics</em> published a paper that indicates we shouldn't necessarily view that as an obstacle. The paper describes a team of German researchers who managed to obtain quantum keys transmitted from a moving aircraft.</p></div><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/04/quantum-encryption-keys-obtained-from-a-moving-plane/#p3n\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/04/quantum-encryption-keys-obtained-from-a-moving-plane/?comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=6LytgL_gCrQ:AqUTq2URuLM:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=6LytgL_gCrQ:AqUTq2URuLM:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=6LytgL_gCrQ:AqUTq2URuLM:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=6LytgL_gCrQ:AqUTq2URuLM:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=6LytgL_gCrQ:AqUTq2URuLM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=6LytgL_gCrQ:AqUTq2URuLM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/science/~4/6LytgL_gCrQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/04/quantum-encryption-keys-obtained-from-a-moving-plane/feed/") (slash:comments nil "0") (feedburner:origLink nil "http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/04/quantum-encryption-keys-obtained-from-a-moving-plane/")) (item nil (title nil "Nanoparticles formed using human viruses, to fight human viruses") (link nil "http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~r/arstechnica/science/~3/28OPtdr3U30/") (comments nil "http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/04/nanoparticles-formed-using-human-viruses-to-fight-human-viruses/#comments") (pubDate nil "Mon, 01 Apr 2013 23:10:15 +0000") (dc:creator nil "Akshat Rathi") (category nil "Scientific Method") (category nil "Biology") (category nil "medicine") (category nil "nanotechnology") (category nil "viruses") (guid ((isPermaLink .

If you haven’t noticed, the ocean is awfully big, and it holds a great deal more heat energy than the atmosphere. In fact, about 90 percent of the energy that’s been added to the climate system by human activities has gone into the ocean.</p><p>Unfortunately, it’s hard to monitor that. There are a multitude of measuring stations for surface air temperatures, but our presence in the ocean is limited. With the advent of the <a href=\"http://www.argo.ucsd.edu/\">Argo array</a>—a fleet of autonomous, drifting floats that measure ocean temperatures—in the early 2000s, our data improved drastically. Still, the uncertainty has historically been greater for deeper waters.</p><p>In 2010, <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/328/5976/316.short\">researchers identified</a> an imbalance in our global energy arithmetic. If we measure the energy that's being trapped by increasing greenhouse gases, some of it seems to disappear—there wasn’t enough warming in the atmosphere or shallow ocean to account for all that extra energy— and there's been a deficit since 2004. (Though a <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/science/2012/01/missing-ocean-heat-explained/\">later study</a> suggested the mismatch might be within the margin of error for the temperature estimates.)</p></div><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/04/oceans-continue-to-warm-especially-the-deeps/#p3n\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/04/oceans-continue-to-warm-especially-the-deeps/?comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=G2BokptjqVA:RuTRcAHAVOs:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=G2BokptjqVA:RuTRcAHAVOs:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=G2BokptjqVA:RuTRcAHAVOs:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=G2BokptjqVA:RuTRcAHAVOs:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=G2BokptjqVA:RuTRcAHAVOs:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=G2BokptjqVA:RuTRcAHAVOs:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/science/~4/G2BokptjqVA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/04/oceans-continue-to-warm-especially-the-deeps/feed/") (slash:comments nil "0") (feedburner:origLink nil "http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/04/oceans-continue-to-warm-especially-the-deeps/")) (item nil (title nil "Urban planners may cry “bring us a shrubbery” to deter crime") (link nil "http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~r/arstechnica/science/~3/SHqMoXVRtqI/") (comments nil "http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/04/urban-planners-may-cry-bring-us-a-shrubbery-to-deter-crime/#comments") (pubDate nil "Mon, 01 Apr 2013 18:33:42 +0000") (dc:creator nil "James Holloway") (category nil "Scientific Method") (guid ((isPermaLink .

They are unmistakable and stretch for miles, giving the landscape an ethereal and otherworldly feel. Many possible explanations have been proposed, including toxic substances in the soil, meteorites, termites, UFOs, and the ghosts of dead natives. But the circles are extremely remote—more than 110 miles from the nearest village—and have been difficult to study scientifically. Despite decades of research, the cause of these bizarre circles has remained elusive.</p><p>But now, after a six-year study and more than 40 trips to the Namib Desert, Dr. Norbert Juergens believes he has come to understand the biological underpinnings of this strange phenomenon. According to Juergens, a single species of termites is responsible for creating and maintaining the circles. But the barren circles aren't just a byproduct of these tiny insects living below the sandy desert surface; they are part of a carefully cultivated landscape that helps the termites—and many other organisms—thrive in an otherwise inhospitable climate.</p><p>Juergens hypothesized that if the fairy circles’ cause was biological, the organism would need to co-occur with the circles and would probably not be found elsewhere. Only one species fit the bill: <i>Psammotermes allocerus</i>, the sand termite. Not only was the sand termite the only insect species that lived across the entire range of the fairy circles, but these termites were found to be living beneath nearly every circle sampled. And the harder the termites worked – foraging, burrowing, and dumping their refuse – the more grass died, leading Juergens to conclude that the termites keep the circles barren by burrowing underground and foraging on the roots of germinating grasses.</p></div><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/03/by-building-fairy-circles-termites-engineer-their-own-ecosystem/#p3n\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/03/by-building-fairy-circles-termites-engineer-their-own-ecosystem/?comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=A7JhfREpoQQ:KMFTBlEqxF8:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=A7JhfREpoQQ:KMFTBlEqxF8:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=A7JhfREpoQQ:KMFTBlEqxF8:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=A7JhfREpoQQ:KMFTBlEqxF8:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=A7JhfREpoQQ:KMFTBlEqxF8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=A7JhfREpoQQ:KMFTBlEqxF8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/science/~4/A7JhfREpoQQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/03/by-building-fairy-circles-termites-engineer-their-own-ecosystem/feed/") (slash:comments nil "0") (feedburner:origLink nil "http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/03/by-building-fairy-circles-termites-engineer-their-own-ecosystem/")) (item nil (title nil "Weird Science thinks seven sexes is enough for anybody") (link nil "http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~r/arstechnica/science/~3/SikUrCqTYOI/") (comments nil "http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/03/weird-science-thinks-seven-sexes-is-enough-for-anybody/#comments") (pubDate nil "Sat, 30 Mar 2013 18:07:45 +0000") (dc:creator nil "John Timmer") (category nil "Scientific Method") (category nil "Week in review") (category nil "Weird Science") (guid ((isPermaLink .

So, the organism uses something akin to sexes to avoid this. If it divides, the two cells that result will be the same sex, and can't mate.</p><p>All very sensible, until you get to one tiny detail: for no obvious reason, <a href=\"http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1001518\"><em>Tetrahymena</em> have decided they need seven sexes</a>. The new paper figures out how that actually works. In the chromosomes used for mating, they have a set of seven inactive half-genes, located next to a different half gene that will ensure that the protein made from it ends up on the cell's surface. When mating occurs, one of the set of seven is selected at random, linked up to the other half, and converted into a functional gene. When the gene product is on the cell's surface, that cell will not be able to mate with any other cell that has the same arrangement.</p><p><strong>Now we'll need an extra set of lasers.</strong> If you were to happen across this <a href=\"http://www.eurekalert.org/multimedia/pub/54407.php?from=235818\">two-headed shark foetus</a>, what would your first thought be?

							Aurich Lawson / Thinkstock				</div></div></div><p>\"From idea to science\" is a process, and as such, it's become a series here. We've discussed what I perceive to be the institutional boundary conditions that constrain my academic success, then followed that with a long exposition on the science that gets me out of bed in the morning. But now it's time to get specific. This is the part that I admittedly have difficulty with: turning ideas and desires into concrete plans. Or, at least making them into plans that are acceptable to people who provide money.</p><p>Today, let's take the general idea from <em></em>last time and break it up into individual, graduate-student-sized projects. In one sense, this is easy—just come up with three sets of experiments. Unfortunately, they need to tie together <em>intellectually</em>. It isn't necessary that the students need to work together on everything, but, thematically, they should be sufficiently related. That way, the students can assist each other when problems arise.</p><p>Getting specific also means thinking about who I am going to ask for money and how much. The European Research Council is offering up to €2 million (about $2.59 million) over five years to a few clever and competent researchers fitting a certain profile. I need to be relatively young—you must have held your PhD for less than 12 years—and you should be looking to strengthen an existing research group. There are other criteria, but those are the two that give you the essence of what they are looking for: new researchers trying to get more independence. As for the money, it sounds like a lot, but, for what I want to do, it will provide for three PhD students over the entire period.</p></div><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/03/from-idea-to-science-pouring-concrete-for-an-experiment-and-securing-funds/#p3n\">Read 22 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/03/from-idea-to-science-pouring-concrete-for-an-experiment-and-securing-funds/?comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=XUNKenjYGpk:FNuF1jrlFVU:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=XUNKenjYGpk:FNuF1jrlFVU:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=XUNKenjYGpk:FNuF1jrlFVU:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=XUNKenjYGpk:FNuF1jrlFVU:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=XUNKenjYGpk:FNuF1jrlFVU:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=XUNKenjYGpk:FNuF1jrlFVU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/science/~4/XUNKenjYGpk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/03/from-idea-to-science-pouring-concrete-for-an-experiment-and-securing-funds/feed/") (slash:comments nil "0") (feedburner:origLink nil "http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/03/from-idea-to-science-pouring-concrete-for-an-experiment-and-securing-funds/")) (item nil (title nil "What remains of an irradiated, damaged, and abandoned Japanese town") (link nil "http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~r/arstechnica/science/~3/9pd2rsa-gKs/") (comments nil "http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/03/what-remains-of-an-irradiated-damaged-and-abandoned-japanese-town/#comments") (pubDate nil "Fri, 29 Mar 2013 21:50:36 +0000") (dc:creator nil "Casey Johnston") (category nil "Ministry of Innovation") (category nil "Scientific Method") (category nil "Fukushima") (category nil "gallery") (category nil "google") (category nil "google maps") (category nil "Japan") (category nil "namie") (category nil "nuclear accident") (category nil "nuclear power") (guid ((isPermaLink .

Within the first category, supernovae vary greatly depending on a number of details, including the mass of the exploding star. On the other hand, white dwarfs seem to all explode in very similar ways, which is why they have proven useful in measuring distances across the Universe.</p><p>Beginning in 2002, astronomers started recognizing a peculiar type of explosion. Since then, they've identified 25 of them; they resemble white dwarf supernovas in many respects, but strongly differ in others. A new paper by Ryan J. Foley and colleagues offered an explanation: these were an entirely new type of white dwarf explosion, one involving less energy and more material from a companion star. So much less energy, in fact, that the authors suspect that the white dwarf may not be fully destroyed in these odd events.</p><p>In the early days of supernova research, explosions were classified primarily by how much hydrogen and helium they had in their spectra. Type I supernovas, for example, mostly lack both elements. Since stars are mostly composed of hydrogen and helium, that indicates progenitor systems for type I supernovae are unlikely to be exploding stars.</p></div><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/03/peculiar-explosions-could-be-a-new-type-of-supernova/#p3n\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/03/peculiar-explosions-could-be-a-new-type-of-supernova/?comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=FGInWrEJqBc:mYPDqMAXF5o:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=FGInWrEJqBc:mYPDqMAXF5o:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=FGInWrEJqBc:mYPDqMAXF5o:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=FGInWrEJqBc:mYPDqMAXF5o:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=FGInWrEJqBc:mYPDqMAXF5o:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=FGInWrEJqBc:mYPDqMAXF5o:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/science/~4/FGInWrEJqBc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/03/peculiar-explosions-could-be-a-new-type-of-supernova/feed/") (slash:comments nil "0") (feedburner:origLink nil "http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/03/peculiar-explosions-could-be-a-new-type-of-supernova/")) (item nil (title nil "Bold asteroid-snatching plans to appear in NASA 2014 budget") (link nil "http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~r/arstechnica/science/~3/ukoKdZ4YFoM/") (comments nil "http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/03/bold-asteroid-snatching-plans-to-appear-in-nasa-2014-budget/#comments") (pubDate nil "Fri, 29 Mar 2013 17:15:15 +0000") (dc:creator nil "Lee Hutchinson") (category nil "Scientific Method") (category nil "asteroid") (category nil "asteroid mining") (category nil "augustine") (category nil "congress") (category nil "flexible path") (category nil "NASA") (category nil "obama") (category nil "orion") (category nil "sls") (category nil "space") (guid ((isPermaLink .

But it also turns out that mutations are probabilistic. Some of them are a bit more or less likely, depending on the chemistry of the DNA base and its location in the genome.</p><p>Now, researchers have identified a mechanism that makes certain types of mutation more probable. This mechanism is a head-on collision between proteins that involves the complex that copies DNA when a cell divides. Because of the mechanics of these collisions, there's a distinct bias towards mutations occurring on one of the two strands of DNA that make up a double helix. The researchers found that this bias is so fundamental that bacterial genes are arranged to take advantage of it, so that some key genes are kept safer from mutations, while others that are key to adaptation can mutate more often.</p><p>The problem with collisions arises from the structure of DNA itself. The sugars in the molecule's backbone have a distinctive top (the 5' carbon) and bottom (the 3' carbon). Even in a molecule that's millions of sugars long, every single one of those is oriented the same way. If you move down the strand in one direction, you'll always hit the 5' end first (if you go in the other direction, you'll always hit the 3' end).</p></div><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/03/head-on-collisions-of-proteins-create-mutations/#p3n\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/03/head-on-collisions-of-proteins-create-mutations/?comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=YyOPpLwCkmA:AjOn16qjtxg:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=YyOPpLwCkmA:AjOn16qjtxg:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=YyOPpLwCkmA:AjOn16qjtxg:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=YyOPpLwCkmA:AjOn16qjtxg:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=YyOPpLwCkmA:AjOn16qjtxg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=YyOPpLwCkmA:AjOn16qjtxg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/science/~4/YyOPpLwCkmA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/03/head-on-collisions-of-proteins-create-mutations/feed/") (slash:comments nil "0") (feedburner:origLink nil "http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/03/head-on-collisions-of-proteins-create-mutations/")) (item nil (title nil "Earth-shattering kabooms: A supernova in our lifetimes?")

It's actually a binary system, consisting of a normal star about 1.7 times the mass of the Sun locked in mutual orbit with a white dwarf. While a low-mass star like that isn't big enough to explode on its own (the minimum supernova mass is 8 times the Sun's), its companion changes the situation. White dwarfs are the remains of Sun-like stars, but they have a maximum mass—the Chandrasekhar limit—beyond which they explode. When the primary star in IK Pegasi runs out of nuclear fuel in a few million years' time, it will expand enough that it transfers gas to its companion. Eventually, enough gas will transfer to the white dwarf and the whole system will explode as a type Ia supernova.

A similar binary system, Sirius, is even closer at 8.6 light-years' distance. However, it's much farther from death, and may not even die as a type Ia supernova.

Having most probably started in Taiwan, the explorers reached and settled on islands across most of the Pacific, as far north as Hawaii and as far south as New Zealand. And recent evidence shows that they also <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/01/polynesians-reached-south-america-picked-up-sweet-potatoes-went-home/\">stopped in South America</a>, where they stayed long enough to pick up food crops that eventually wound up distributed across the Pacific as well.</p><p>By the time they reached South America, however, several large and sophisticated civilizations had already developed along the west coast of that continent. This is in sharp contrast to the uninhabited islands that the Polynesians were used to colonizing, which raises questions about whether any of the voyagers were likely to have stayed in the newly discovered land. Genetic surveys of native populations in Peru and elsewhere have indicated that, if any did stick around, they didn't make a significant contribution to the local gene pool.</p><p>But now, some researchers have found some Polynesian DNA in the remains of some Native Americans.

Indeed, many physicists believed that the world was essentially mechanical and deterministic. More importantly, everyone was thinking about mechanical solutions to problems. In that milieu, it seemed natural to think of computing in terms of gears, chains, sprockets, and cams. The result was mechanical computers.</p><p>Once the electronics revolution hit full stride, these machines ended up being remembered as the pinnacle of a bygone age. Now, in a blast from the past, a pair of researchers from New Zealand have <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4793648\">demonstrated</a> an updated version of the mechanical computer: an artificial, muscle-based computer. It's slow and bulky, and it can't do a lot, but the researchers argue that it has great potential for robotics.</p><p>To implement their computer, the researchers returned to the original work of Alan Turing, who envisioned a computer as a read-write head that operated on a linear tape. The write operations depend on the results of read operations and whatever program might be in memory. This machine can, in principle, solve any problem that is solvable by a computer and is known as a universal Turing machine, of which modern computers are an example.</p></div><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/04/reflexive-computer-is-a-turing-machine-made-with-artificial-muscle/#p3n\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/04/reflexive-computer-is-a-turing-machine-made-with-artificial-muscle/?comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=h53CXBj93eY:OlP4IuqnyEU:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=h53CXBj93eY:OlP4IuqnyEU:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=h53CXBj93eY:OlP4IuqnyEU:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=h53CXBj93eY:OlP4IuqnyEU:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=h53CXBj93eY:OlP4IuqnyEU:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=h53CXBj93eY:OlP4IuqnyEU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/science/~4/h53CXBj93eY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/04/reflexive-computer-is-a-turing-machine-made-with-artificial-muscle/feed/") (slash:comments nil "0") (enclosure ((url .

The atmosphere's warming can be slowed by <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/04/oceans-continue-to-warm-especially-the-deeps/\">heat storage in the ocean</a>, but that slow transport of heat generally means there's a lag—longer time periods are required for changes to be seen in the atmosphere.</p></div><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/04/climate-change-may-be-irreversible-but-we-control-the-future-trajectory/#p3n\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/04/climate-change-may-be-irreversible-but-we-control-the-future-trajectory/?comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=0PJ2iWSiDrU:Skd2OaSO9dA:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=0PJ2iWSiDrU:Skd2OaSO9dA:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=0PJ2iWSiDrU:Skd2OaSO9dA:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=0PJ2iWSiDrU:Skd2OaSO9dA:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=0PJ2iWSiDrU:Skd2OaSO9dA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=0PJ2iWSiDrU:Skd2OaSO9dA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/science/~4/0PJ2iWSiDrU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/04/climate-change-may-be-irreversible-but-we-control-the-future-trajectory/feed/") (slash:comments nil "0") (feedburner:origLink nil "http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/04/climate-change-may-be-irreversible-but-we-control-the-future-trajectory/"))) ("Particle detector in space has mixed news on dark matter" "<div id=\"rss-wrap\"><div><img src=\"http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/AMS_in_situ.jpg\"><div class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><div class=\"caption-text\">The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS-02) particle detector, mounted on the International Space Station.</div><div class=\"caption-byline\"><a href=\"http://press.web.cern.ch/backgrounders/first-result-ams-experiment\">NASA</a></div></div></div><p>The hunt for dark matter has been a difficult one.

Don't expect to see a styrofoam battery in your next cellphone though, as the material needs to be heated to 60°C in order to work.</p><p>The problem with liquid electrolytes has to do with the fact that, during recharging, lithium ions end up forming deposits of metal inside the battery. These create risks of short circuits (the problem that grounded Boeing's Dreamliner 787) and can damage the battery's structure, causing leaks and a fire risk. Solid electrodes get around this because the lithium ions will only come out of the electrolyte at specific locations within the solid, and can't form the large metal deposits that cause all of the problems.</p></div><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/04/solid-electrolyte-may-end-the-catastrophic-failures-of-lithium-batteries/#p3n\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/04/solid-electrolyte-may-end-the-catastrophic-failures-of-lithium-batteries/?comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=fN_vO3XUWVY:O7ATnJ-L_jM:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=fN_vO3XUWVY:O7ATnJ-L_jM:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=fN_vO3XUWVY:O7ATnJ-L_jM:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=fN_vO3XUWVY:O7ATnJ-L_jM:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=fN_vO3XUWVY:O7ATnJ-L_jM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=fN_vO3XUWVY:O7ATnJ-L_jM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/science/~4/fN_vO3XUWVY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/04/solid-electrolyte-may-end-the-catastrophic-failures-of-lithium-batteries/feed/") (slash:comments nil "0") (feedburner:origLink nil "http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/04/solid-electrolyte-may-end-the-catastrophic-failures-of-lithium-batteries/"))) ("Quantum encryption keys obtained from a moving plane" "<div id=\"rss-wrap\"><div><img src=\"http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/4811041163_660cbc1e34_z.jpg\"><div class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><div class=\"caption-text\">(No, not the actual plane used.)</div><div class=\"caption-byline\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/gianluca_miche/4811041163/\">Gianluca Micheletti</a></div></div></div><p>Here in the Ars science section, we cover a lot of interesting research that may eventually lead to the sort of technology discussed in other areas of the site.

All the women of that group carried DNA inherited from just one woman, commonly known as mitochondrial Eve, whose DNA was inherited by all humans alive today. But the exact timing of this migration is not clear, and it has sparked debate among geneticists. Now, new research published in <em>Current Biology</em> may help calm both sides.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Studies of evolutionary events often involve the use of molecular clocks based on changes in DNA that accumulate over time. To accurately calibrate a clock, it helps to have a measure of the rate of mutations.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In 2012, UK Researchers used a method of analysis that involves DNA from the nucleus of present day humans. Armed with data from parents and their offspring, they <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22965354\">estimated</a> a new, much lower rate of DNA mutation. Based on their results, it would seem that human DNA may change much more slowly than was previously thought. The slow mutation rate puts the date of human migration out of Africa at somewhere between 90,000 and 130,000 years ago.</p></div><p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/03/fossil-dna-used-to-reset-humanitys-clock/#p3n\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/03/fossil-dna-used-to-reset-humanitys-clock/?comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=5tif9U_spv0:ginFE_Fp9i8:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=5tif9U_spv0:ginFE_Fp9i8:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=5tif9U_spv0:ginFE_Fp9i8:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=5tif9U_spv0:ginFE_Fp9i8:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=5tif9U_spv0:ginFE_Fp9i8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=5tif9U_spv0:ginFE_Fp9i8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/science/~4/5tif9U_spv0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/03/fossil-dna-used-to-reset-humanitys-clock/feed/") (slash:comments nil "0") (feedburner:origLink nil "http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/03/fossil-dna-used-to-reset-humanitys-clock/"))))
