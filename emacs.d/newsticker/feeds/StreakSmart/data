That changed today, though &#8211; but it isn&#8217;t very good news for fans of Dell&#8217;s Streak series of devices.</p><p>The head of Dell&#8217;s consumer business Jeff Clarke confirmed that Dell is truly getting out of the smartphone business, and is even dropping <a href=\"http://www.pocketables.com/android\">Android</a> for the time being. According to Clarke, the smartphone business requires &#8220;a lot of investments to really be successful,&#8221; and Dell seems not to be willing to spend money on them.</p><p>When asked about Google&#8217;s popular Android operating system, Clarke had this to say: &#8220;It’s a content play with Android. Amazon is selling books and Google is making it up with search. So far we couldn’t find a way to build a business on Android.&#8221; In other words, Dell wants to have more revenue coming from Android than the money it gets from device sales &#8211; and that until that happens, Dell might not be interested in shipping Android devices since it doesn&#8217;t view them as particularly profitable.</p><p>However, Clarke went on to say that Dell isn&#8217;t uninterested in producing devices with Android. Apparently, Dell is working on some Android devices in its labs &#8211; but they&#8217;re likely not ready at the moment and might not be for some time, until Dell can find a way to get a bit of extra money from the OS.</p><p>Are you saddened that, as of right now, Dell will not be producing any more smartphones?</p><p>[<a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/jeanbaptiste/2012/12/12/dell-quits-smartphone-business-globally-android/\">Forbes</a>]</p><p>The post <a href=\"http://www.pocketables.com/2012/12/dell-officially-gets-out-of-smartphone-business-android.html\">Dell officially gets out of smartphone business, Android</a> appeared first on <a href=\"http://www.pocketables.com\">Pocketables</a>.</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/StreakSmart/~4/rtSKPSmQe8U\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://www.pocketables.com/2012/12/dell-officially-gets-out-of-smartphone-business-android.html/feed") (slash:comments nil "10") (feedburner:origLink nil "http://www.pocketables.com/2012/12/dell-officially-gets-out-of-smartphone-business-android.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=dell-officially-gets-out-of-smartphone-business-android")) (item nil (title nil "Dell Streak 5 gets MTD-Utils for flashing to booted Android system") (link nil "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/StreakSmart/~3/Sm7uHtXRWC4/dell-streak-5-gets-mtd-utils-for-flashing-to-booted-android-system.html") (comments nil "http://www.pocketables.com/2012/10/dell-streak-5-gets-mtd-utils-for-flashing-to-booted-android-system.html#comments") (pubDate nil "Fri, 19 Oct 2012 19:56:28 +0000") (dc:creator nil "Calob Horton") (category nil "Android") (category nil "StreakSmart") (category nil "Dell") (category nil "MTD-Utils") (category nil "Streak 5") (guid ((isPermaLink .

Perhaps most notable about the suite of tools, though, is the fact that the <em>nandwrite</em> tool allows you to flash a recovery while Android is already booted.</p><p>As _n0p_ puts it:</p><blockquote><p>nandwrite should enable you to write boot, recovery, system and firstboot right from android system (i don’t think that it’s good idea, but anyway) [<em>sic</em>]</p></blockquote><p>The developer does say that it may not be a good idea, but the fact that it works is commendable &#8211; and very useful.

I&#8217;ll stop by every so often too. <em>If you don&#8217;t know or remember me, hello there. My name is Jenn, and I founded Pocketables in 2006 and G&amp;E and SS in 2010.</em></p><p>While we hope that faithful readers of these sites will become devoted readers of this site, we understand that some of you may not be ready for the change. That&#8217;s okay. We&#8217;ve made a special top menu bar for you with links to take you directly to where you want to go to see only the content you want to see.</p><p>Click &#8220;GOOD AND EVO,&#8221; for example, and you&#8217;ll find <em>everything</em> from the old G&amp;E plus all the new EVO-related content you would&#8217;ve seen if the site had been untouched. In other words, it&#8217;s the same G&amp;E you&#8217;ve always known; it&#8217;s just at a different URL. And since you&#8217;re reading this, you already know that GoodAndEVO.net now redirects to pocketables.com/htc-evo (NothingButTablets.com takes you to pocketables.com/tablets and StreakSmart.com leads to pocketables.com/dell-streak). Our social media links have not been changed and will continue to display the content you&#8217;re used to; that is, you&#8217;ll still find only G&amp;E content autopublished to the G&amp;E Twitter feed.</p><p>When you&#8217;re ready to venture beyond the G&amp;E/NBT/SS &#8220;micro site&#8221; to see what the entire Pocketables has to offer, just click back to the main home page and you&#8217;ll find all the G&amp;E/NBT/SS posts seamlessly merged with the content from the rest of the site.</p><h2>Design Overhaul</h2><p>Now let&#8217;s talk about the new design, which is undoubtedly the first thing you noticed. Regardless of which site you&#8217;re coming from, we know this is completely different from it.</p><p>Change always takes some getting used to, so while we don&#8217;t expect everyone to immediately embrace the makeover, we hope you&#8217;ll focus on and enjoy the content more than any layout element.</p><p>That said, however, we do think our new look is a change for the better. It&#8217;s fresher, sleeker, and more representative of what the new Pocketables is all about. At the top of our main home page we have quick links to the G&amp;E, NBT, and SS sections, as well as the CrowdGadgets website. Below that is our updated logo and navigation bar to the main areas of the site, including our forum. Then you&#8217;re looking at our Featured Posts Slider, which is regularly updated to display 5 of the best posts across the site, followed by 10 of our most recent posts, each in its own little box. Click on any photo or title to view the entire post. The sidebar on the right contains a search bar, social media links, and other useful information, and you&#8217;ll find our latest tweets at the bottom of the page.</p><p>- &#8211; - &#8211; - &#8211; - &#8211; -</p><p>And that&#8217;s the new Pocketables! We all think it&#8217;s going to be awesome and hope you&#8217;ll give us the opportunity to prove that to you. Whether you&#8217;ve been here since the site was pink and about UMPCs, this is your first visit, or you fall anywhere in between, thanks for reading and allowing us to do what we love to do. No one knows where this new path will lead us, but I hope we can find out together.</p><p>The post <a href=\"http://www.pocketables.com/2012/05/welcome-to-the-new-pocketables.html\">Welcome to the new Pocketables!</a> appeared first on <a href=\"http://www.pocketables.com\">Pocketables</a>.</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/StreakSmart/~4/4NtMm3MZewc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://www.pocketables.com/2012/05/welcome-to-the-new-pocketables.html/feed") (slash:comments nil "73") (feedburner:origLink nil "http://www.pocketables.com/2012/05/welcome-to-the-new-pocketables.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=welcome-to-the-new-pocketables")) (item nil (title nil "Ice Monkey selling Dell Streak 7 for $150 while supplies last") (link nil "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/StreakSmart/~3/4w3kKLzT8hM/ice-monkey-selling-dell-streak-7-for-150-while-supplies-last.html") (comments nil "http://www.pocketables.com/2012/05/ice-monkey-selling-dell-streak-7-for-150-while-supplies-last.html#comments") (pubDate nil "Thu, 24 May 2012 23:58:58 +0000") (dc:creator nil "Calob Horton") (category nil "StreakSmart") (guid ((isPermaLink .

That changed today, though – but it isn’t very good news for fans of Dell’s Streak series of devices.</p><p>The head of Dell’s consumer business Jeff Clarke confirmed that Dell is truly getting out of the smartphone business, and is even dropping <a href=\"http://www.pocketables.com/android\">Android</a> for the time being. According to Clarke, the smartphone business requires “a lot of investments to really be successful,” and Dell seems not to be willing to spend money on them.</p><p>When asked about Google’s popular Android operating system, Clarke had this to say: “It’s a content play with Android. Amazon is selling books and Google is making it up with search. So far we couldn’t find a way to build a business on Android.” In other words, Dell wants to have more revenue coming from Android than the money it gets from device sales – and that until that happens, Dell might not be interested in shipping Android devices since it doesn’t view them as particularly profitable.</p><p>However, Clarke went on to say that Dell isn’t uninterested in producing devices with Android. Apparently, Dell is working on some Android devices in its labs – but they’re likely not ready at the moment and might not be for some time, until Dell can find a way to get a bit of extra money from the OS.</p><p>Are you saddened that, as of right now, Dell will not be producing any more smartphones?</p><p>[<a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/jeanbaptiste/2012/12/12/dell-quits-smartphone-business-globally-android/\">Forbes</a>]</p><p>The post <a href=\"http://www.pocketables.com/2012/12/dell-officially-gets-out-of-smartphone-business-android.html\">Dell officially gets out of smartphone business, Android</a> appeared first on <a href=\"http://www.pocketables.com\">Pocketables</a>.</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/StreakSmart/~4/rtSKPSmQe8U\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>" "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/StreakSmart/~3/rtSKPSmQe8U/dell-officially-gets-out-of-smartphone-business-android.html" (20682 19633) new 1 nil nil ((title nil "Dell officially gets out of smartphone business, Android") (link nil "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/StreakSmart/~3/rtSKPSmQe8U/dell-officially-gets-out-of-smartphone-business-android.html") (comments nil "http://www.pocketables.com/2012/12/dell-officially-gets-out-of-smartphone-business-android.html#comments") (pubDate nil "Thu, 13 Dec 2012 21:46:25 +0000") (dc:creator nil "Calob Horton") (category nil "Android") (category nil "StreakSmart") (category nil "Dell") (category nil "Dell Streak") (category nil "Streak") (category nil "Streak 5") (category nil "Streak 7") (guid ((isPermaLink .

That changed today, though &#8211; but it isn&#8217;t very good news for fans of Dell&#8217;s Streak series of devices.</p><p>The head of Dell&#8217;s consumer business Jeff Clarke confirmed that Dell is truly getting out of the smartphone business, and is even dropping <a href=\"http://www.pocketables.com/android\">Android</a> for the time being. According to Clarke, the smartphone business requires &#8220;a lot of investments to really be successful,&#8221; and Dell seems not to be willing to spend money on them.</p><p>When asked about Google&#8217;s popular Android operating system, Clarke had this to say: &#8220;It’s a content play with Android. Amazon is selling books and Google is making it up with search. So far we couldn’t find a way to build a business on Android.&#8221; In other words, Dell wants to have more revenue coming from Android than the money it gets from device sales &#8211; and that until that happens, Dell might not be interested in shipping Android devices since it doesn&#8217;t view them as particularly profitable.</p><p>However, Clarke went on to say that Dell isn&#8217;t uninterested in producing devices with Android. Apparently, Dell is working on some Android devices in its labs &#8211; but they&#8217;re likely not ready at the moment and might not be for some time, until Dell can find a way to get a bit of extra money from the OS.</p><p>Are you saddened that, as of right now, Dell will not be producing any more smartphones?</p><p>[<a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/jeanbaptiste/2012/12/12/dell-quits-smartphone-business-globally-android/\">Forbes</a>]</p><p>The post <a href=\"http://www.pocketables.com/2012/12/dell-officially-gets-out-of-smartphone-business-android.html\">Dell officially gets out of smartphone business, Android</a> appeared first on <a href=\"http://www.pocketables.com\">Pocketables</a>.</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/StreakSmart/~4/rtSKPSmQe8U\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://www.pocketables.com/2012/12/dell-officially-gets-out-of-smartphone-business-android.html/feed") (slash:comments nil "10") (feedburner:origLink nil "http://www.pocketables.com/2012/12/dell-officially-gets-out-of-smartphone-business-android.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=dell-officially-gets-out-of-smartphone-business-android"))) ("Dell Streak 5 gets MTD-Utils for flashing to booted Android system" "<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-58502\" title=\"streak5\" src=\"http://www.pocketables.com/images/2012/10/streak5-608x297.jpg\" alt=\"streak5 608x297 Dell Streak 5 gets MTD Utils for flashing to booted Android system\" width=\"608\" height=\"297\" /></p><p>The Dell Streak 5 has been dead for a little over a year now, but there are more than a few people who still love the original phablet.
