  <p>In 1989, we saw the release of <em>The Wizard</em>, a road trip movie about video games starring child actor Fred Savage. But everybody knew that it wasn't really a movie about video games or road trips &mdash; it was a movie about selling <em>Super Mario Bros. 3</em> and other Nintendo products. Nearly 25 years later, we have <em>The Internship</em>, a buddy comedy about two old guys trying to reinvent themselves for the 21st-century economy starring Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson. But everybody knows (or will know) that it isn't really a movie about friendship or new beginnings &mdash; it's a movie about selling Google.</p>

<p>Not since <em>The Wizard</em> has a movie been so in the bag for a corporation. It&rsquo;s incredibly difficult to watch <em>The Internship</em> as simply a movie and not as...</p>

He attended University of Virginia from 2006-2010 starting just after he performed \"the goal of a lifetime\" in a September 2006 match against Charlton. He was hired at PCMag in 2010 and changed his squad number to 10, previously used by Dennis Bergkamp. In 2011 he joined The Verge and became club captain following the transfer of Cesc F&agrave;bregas to FC Barcelona. As of March 2013, he is the host of Top Shelf, and then one month later he contributed to Manchester United's 20th league title.</p>

  <p>Adobe has always been a software company, but last month <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2013/5/6/4305712/adobe-announces-first-hardware-the-project-mighty-smart-stylus\">it revealed it was tinkering with something new</a>: hardware. Its first efforts are Project Mighty, a smart stylus <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2013/5/6/4305300/adobe-announces-creative-suite-update-and-rebranding-focus-on-cloud\">with Creative Cloud integration</a>, and Project Napoleon, a smart ruler that can create a variety of different shapes. The company is calling the tools \"experiments\" &mdash; not products &mdash; but it's clear that Adobe has put a lot of thought into them both. We've just gotten a chance to play around with their early prototypes to get a better sense of how they work.</p>

  <p>The ITC has banned Apple from importing some models of iPhone and iPad because they infringe on a Samsung patent. In a cease and desist order issued today, the International Trade Commission ordered Apple to stop importing AT&amp;T models of the iPhone 4, the 3GS and 3G, the iPad 3G, and the iPad 2 3G into the US. According to Samsung, Apple used a cellular data patent in developing older versions of its iPhone and iPad; newer models do not use technology covered in its claim. While the ITC did not agree that Apple had violated several other patents in Samsung's complaint, it said that Apple had not provided a strong defense against claims that it infringed on the '348 patent.</p>

  <p>Apple just released its latest update to OS X, version 10.8.4. It's a relatively small revision that primarily focuses on minor bug fixes, but there is one promising change for iMessage users. Apple says that it's now fixed an annoying issue that would display your iMessage conversations out of order. After installing the update and checking our messages, we're still seeing some chats that aren't displayed properly, but presumably Apple's resolution will ensure that your future messages won't get thrown out of whack. The update also alleviates many of the pains of searching with Messages, which used to cause system hangups and crazy amounts of processor usage</p>

  <p>Bose today rolled out its first ever noise-cancelling earbuds, the QuietComfort 20s, along with its latest portable Bluetooth speaker, the SoundLink Mini. In typical fashion, the company heralded both products as revolutionary and the result of extensive research and development. \"New headphones and Bluetooth speakers are being introduced almost every week it seems now,\" said Brian Maguire. \"But we submit that none of them can do what we're about to show you today,\" he went on, claiming that QuietComfort 20 and SoundLink Mini each deliver \"mobile audio like never before.\" But does the hyperbole pan out?

  <p>In Finland, nearly every newborn is sent home with a free, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-22751415\" target=\"_blank\">government-issued cardboard box</a>. The idea might seem a bit strange, but in Finland it's helped dramatically decrease infant mortality rates and perpetuate the idea that children there each start on the same, equal footing, according to a report from the <i>BBC</i>. And what's inside each of these boxes is just as important as the box itself.</p>
